=head2 Using Mig under Windows

I have not tested Mig under IIS, although others have.  I have no Windows
machines to test with (I'm a Mac user), so I rely on reports from the field
to tell me what does and doesn't work.  I did install Mig once on a
laptop running Windows98 and Personal Web Server 4.0 (and PHP4) and it
worked.  But I do not test Windows installations regularly.  Mig is
developed in a unix-like environment (Apple OSX) and my site runs in a
similar environment (FreeBSD), so Mig has a decidedly unix-biased way of
doing things.  But I make an attempt to accomodate Windows users.  If you
find any Windows-centric issues in Mig, please email me at
dan@tangledhelix.com and I'll try to fix them.

=head2 Windows Installation

Windows users will need to modify the install directions a bit.  Read over
F<docs/INSTALL> to get the general idea.  However, instead of using the
F<install.sh> script, you will want to do this:

1. Instead of using gzip and tar, unpack the archive using Winzip or
similar.  Winzip should know how to handle .tar.gz files.  You can
find Winzip at http://www.winzip.com/

2. Create a directory to place your Mig installation in (or if you are
upgrading, just know where the current installation is).  I'll use
F<C:\Mig> as an example in this document, but you can put it anywhere you
want as long as you know how to make your web server look there for the
files.

3. Copy the F<index.php>, F<funcs.php> and F<lang.php> file to your Mig
directory.  This document assumes .php as the extension your web server
uses to recognize PHP files.  If that isn't the case then rename
F<index.php> to F<index.php3> (or whatever extension is appropriate).  Do
NOT rename the other PHP files (their names are hardcoded into the
program)!

4. Create the subdirectories C<images> and C<templates> (i.e.
F<C:\Mig\Images> and F<C:\Mig\Templates>), and copy the files in the
F<images> and F<templates> subdirectories to those directories,
respectively.

5. Create subdirectory C<albums> (i.e. F<C:\Mig\Albums>).  This is where
your albums will live.

6. Make sure you don't write over your own album.  I can't warrant
that won't happen, because I've seen some really odd things happen when
dragging files and folders around in Windows Explorer.  Please be
careful and make backups of your data if at all possible.

7. Copy the F<config.php.default> file to F<config.php> in your Mig directory.
Edit it to taste.  If you are upgrading, you may not need to do this (just
see if there's anything new in F<config.php.default> and update your existing
F<config.php>).

8. Start putting your images in the F<albums> subdirectory (i.e.
F<C:\Mig\Albums>) and there you have it.

=head2 Miscellaneous Notes

I'm told by a user in Germany that Mig works under Windows NT and IIS.
It seems that you'd be well served to upgrade to the latest version of PHP
though.  You can find it at http://www.php.net/

I'm also told by this same user that having a comma in a filename or
directory name causes trouble on their Windows platform (although I have
had no problems with same under Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris or Darwin).
So be aware of
that.  Other special characters may not work either.  It might be safest to
just use alphabetics, numbers and things like underscore and hyphen.
Remember that an underscore will be shown as a space in folder names, so as
far as the folder names go, an underscore is equivalent to a space as far
as Mig is concerned (in folder names, anyway).
