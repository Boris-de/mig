Notes on Jhead

Compiling:
    Under Windows, with Microsoft Visual C on your path, type:
    cl -Ox jhead.c exif.c myglob.c

    Under Linux, type:
    cc -lm -O3 -o jhead jhead.c exif.c 

Liscence:

    Jhead is public domain software - that is, you can do whatever you want
    with it, and include it software that is liscensed under the GNU or the 
    BSD liscence, or whatever other liscence you chose.
    If you do integrate the code into some software of yours, I'd appreciate
    knowing about it though. You can reach me at matt@rim.net
