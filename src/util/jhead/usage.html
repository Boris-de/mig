<b>Jhead is a command line driven program for manipulating the non image parts of Exif flavour
Jpeg files that most digital cameras produce.</b><p>
<b>Jhead has no Graphical User Interface</b>.  Clicking on it with the mouse from Windows won't
do anything for you - you have to <b>use it from the Command prompt</b> (or Dos prompt under Win95/98)

<h3>Jhead program Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Extracting camera settings from exif image files
<li>Removing of integral exif thumbnails for compacting Jpegs without loss of image info
<li>Able to manage running programs on large batches of Jpegs and restoring exif header
    information afterwards.
</ul>

<h3>Command line options</h3>
<table cellpadding=5><tr valign=top>
    <td><font size = 2 face="helvetica"><b>-dt
    <td><font size = 2 face="helvetica">
        Delete thumbnails.  Exif headers have a built-in thumbnail, which typically
        occupies around 10k of space.  As far as I can tell, this thumbnail is only used
        by the digital cameras to display several really small thumbnails at a time.  The
        thumbnails are too small to use even full screen on the digicam's LCD.
        I have not encountered any adverse side effects of deleting the thumbnails, even from the
        software provided with the digicams.<p>
        This command line option simply shortens the exif segment of the jpeg file so that
        the interesting settings are still in the camera.<p>
         
<tr valign=top>
    <td><font size = 2 face="helvetica"><b>-h
    <td><font size = 2 face="helvetica">
        Displays summary of command line options.

<tr valign=top>
    <td><font size = 2 face="helvetica"><b>-v
    <td><font size = 2 face="helvetica">
        Makes the program even more verbose than it already is.  Like dos programs, and unlike
        Unix programs, Jhead gives feedback as to what it is doing, even when nothing goes wrong.
        Windows user that I am, when something doesn't give me feedback for 20 seconds, I assume
        its crashed.

<tr valign=top>
    <td><font size = 2 face="helvetica"><b>-c
    <td><font size = 2 face="helvetica">
        Concise output.  This causes picture info to be summarized on one line instead of several.
        Useful for grep-ing through images, as well as importing into spread sheets (data is space
        delimited with quotes as text qualifier).

<tr valign=top>
    <td><font size = 2 face="helvetica"><b>-model
    <td><font size = 2 face="helvetica">
        Restricts processing of files to those whose camera model, as indicated by the exif image
        information, contains the substring specified in the argument after '-model'.
        For example, the following command will list only images that are from an S100 camera:
        <p>
        jhead -model S100 *.jpg<p>
        <p>
        I use this option to restrict my JPEG re-compressing to those images that came from my digicam,
        see the -cmd option.
        <p>

<tr valign=top>
    <td><font size = 2 face="helvetica"><b>-n
    <td><font size = 2 face="helvetica">
        This option causes files with dates stored in the exif header to be renamed to the
        file date.  Renaming is restricted to files whose names consist largely of digits.
        This effectively restricts renaming to files that have not already been manually renamed.
        Use the -nf option to force renaming.<p>
        The file will be renamed to MMDD-HHMMSS.  The year is not used for the
        file name (if you have images from that many different years together, you probably
        don't care enough about organizing your images to use this program.  If you don't like
        it, you can always change the program.<p>
        If the destination name is already in use (if another photo was taken at the exact same
        time by another camera), the times for next subsequent seconds are tried.<p>
        This option is useful for naming jpegs of the same event taken from two cameras in
        such a way that they will appear in order in file managers and programs like Compupic
        or ACDSee.

<tr valign=top>
    <td><font size = 2 face="helvetica"><b>-nf
    <td><font size = 2 face="helvetica">
        Same as '-n' but renames files regardless of original file name.
        <p>
 

<tr valign=top>
    <td><font size = 2 face="helvetica"><b>-cmd
    <td><font size = 2 face="helvetica">
        Executes the specified command on each Jepg file to be processed.<p>
        The Exif section of each file is read before running the command, and re-inserted
        after the command finishes.<p>
        The specified command invoked separately for each Jpeg that is processed, even if
        multiple files are specified (explicitly or by wild card).
        I use this option to process whole directory trees of Jpegs from my digital camera
        with JPEGTRAN (Independent Jpeg group) and Image-Magic's 'MOGRIFY' command without 
        loosing the camera settings and other info stored in the Exif headers.<p>
        JPEGTRAN is useful for lossless rotation, as well as for converting Jpegs to
        progressive Jpegs (also a lossless process, but results in typically 5% smaller files)
        I use mogrify for re-compressing the images I get from my Canon PowerShot S100 to
        80% quality.  The cannon Jpegs are either way too 'high quality' for the resolution, or
        are suboptimally encoded.  Using mogrify to 80% produces no detectable loss in quality,
        with files about half the size.<p>
        Example use:<br>
        Having a whole directory tree of photos from my S100, I run the following commands:<p>
        <ul>
          jhead -cmd "mogrify -quality 80 &i" -model S100 -r *.jpg<br>
          jhead -cmd "jpegtran -progressive &i &o" -r *.jpg<p>
        </ul>
        The first command mogrifies all jpegs in the tree that indicate that they are from a 
        Cannon S100 in their exif header to 80% quality at the same resolution.  This is a 'lossy'
        process, so I only run it on files that are from the Canon, and only run it once.
        The next command then takes all jpegs and converts them to progressive Jpegs.  The result
        is the same images, with no discernible differences, stored in half the space.
        <p>
        Keeping the Exif header information is important to me, as I like to check things like the
        shutter speed for some of my photos, and my HTML index generting program uses the exif tags
        to display the Jpeg images in order of taking.

        The recursive feature of version 1.0 never worked to my satisfaction, and I replaced it 
        with my recursive file globbing code in the Windows version.  See below.
</table>


<h3>Name globbing and recursive directories under Windows</h3>
<ul>
    Name globbing means matching wildcard patterns to actual file names.  If you know what this
    term means, you are probably annoyed at how programs on Windows typically handle this.
    The Win32 version of this program goes beyond the pattern matching that Windows provides,
    and allows you to specify fancy patterns such as:
    <p>
    <font size = 2 face="courier">&nbsp jhead c:\pix\199*\*\*.jpg<font size = 2 face="helvetica">
    <p>
    This program goes one step beyond beyond that in that "**" as a path component means any
    level of subdirectories.  The invocation
    <p>
    <font size = 2 face="courier">&nbsp jhead c:\**\*.jpg<font size = 2 face="helvetica">
    <p>
    will find ALL Jpegs files on the c: drive, including those in the root directory.  The <font size = 2 face="courier">**<font size = 2 face="helvetica"> 
    is only valid if it is the only path
    component.  For The path <font size = 2 face="courier">'c:\a**\*.jpg'<font size = 2 face="helvetica"> 
    will not recurse.
    The <font size = 2 face="courier">'**'<font size = 2 face="helvetica"> 
    recursive expansion is ONLY supportedd on the Windos version.   The code is in the module 'myglob.c',
    if you want to reuse it (I certainly intend to reuse that code for other applications).
    Under Unix, the shell's wildcard expansion is
    pretty decent already, and dealing with the convoluted nature of some Unix file layouts,
    doing better would have been much more of a challenge.
</ul>

<h3>Programs I use with Jhead</h3>
<b>ImageMagic</b><br>
<ul>
I use the MOGIRIFY command from image magic to do batch conversions and re-compresses of images.
If you use Linux, you probably already have ImageMagic on your system (just type 'mogrify' at the
command prompt to see if you have it).  For Windows users, you have to download it from:
<a href="http://www.imagemagick.org"> http://www.imagemagick.org</a><p>
</ul>
<b>JPEGTRAN</b><br>
<ul>
If you use Linux you probably also already have this program.  For windows, its hard to find a 
pre-built binary on the web.  The <a href="http://www.ijg.org"> Independent Jpeg
Group</a>'s website only has the source code.<p>
There's a fancier version, with pre-built Windows binaries and a lossless cropping feature added at:
<a href="http://sylvana.net/jpegcrop"> http://sylvana.net/jpegcrop</a>.
I have a <a href="http://www.sentex.net/~mwandel/jhead/jpegtran.zip">
Compiled Windows Binary of Jpegtran</a> on my website.  I got this one by taking the source 
code for Jpegtran out of the RedHat 6.1 Linux distribution, and compiling it with Microsoft
Visual C 5.0.
</ul>
<b>CompuPic</b><br>
<ul>
I also use <a href="http://www.photodex.com"> CompuPic </a> to organize my photos.  This unfortunately
is payware, but its a pretty good program.  It has a free two week evaluation period.  After
this period, it is still semi-usable but annoying.  I ended up paying for it.  Or you can then use ACDsee,
which has a longer free evaluation period, but costs much more.  I don't know of a good free program for Windows 
to do the same thing.
</ul>
