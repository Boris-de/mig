<P>
This document tries to explain how to install MiG by hand (for people with
FTP access only, not shell access, to their web server).

<P>
1. Unpack the distribution. If you're on a Unix or Linux system you can do
this with the command:

<P>
<PRE>    tar xvfz mig-VERSION.tar.gz
</PRE>
<P>
Where ``VERSION'' is the version (such as ``1.2.3''). If you're on a
Windows system, try Winzip at <A
HREF="http://www.winzip.com/">http://www.winzip.com/</A>

<P>
2. Create a directory on the server to place your MiG installation in (or
if you are upgrading, just know where the current installation is). I'll
use <EM>/www/site.com/htdocs/gallery</EM> as an example in this document, but you can put it anywhere you want as
long as you know your web server can find the files there.

<P>
3. Copy the <EM>index.php</EM>, <EM>funcs.php</EM> and <EM>lang.php</EM> file to your server's new Mig directory. This document assumes .php as the
extension your web server uses to recognize PHP files. If that isn't the
case then rename <EM>index.php</EM> to <EM>index.php3</EM> (or whatever extension is appropriate). Do NOT rename the other PHP files
(their names are hardcoded into the program)!

<P>
4. Create the subdirectories <CODE>images</CODE> and <CODE>templates</CODE> (i.e.
<EM>/www/site.com/htdocs/gallery/images</EM> and
<EM>/www/site.com/htdocs/gallery/templates</EM>), and copy the files in the
<EM>images</EM> and <EM>templates</EM> subdirectories to those directories, respectively.

<P>
5. Create subdirectory <CODE>albums</CODE> (i.e.
<EM>/www/site.com/htdocs/gallery/albums</EM>). This is where your albums will live. If you want to install the example
gallery, copy the
<EM>Example_Gallery</EM> folder into the albums folder you just created. (Installing the example
gallery is optional)

<P>
6. Copy the <EM>mig.cfg.default</EM> file to <EM>mig.cfg</EM> in your Mig directory. Edit it to taste. If you are upgrading, you may not
need to do this (just see if there's anything new in <EM>mig.cfg.default</EM> and update your existing
<EM>mig.cfg</EM>).

<P>
7. Start putting your images in the <EM>albums</EM> subdirectory (i.e.
<EM>/www/site.com/htdocs/gallery/albums</EM>) and there you have it.
