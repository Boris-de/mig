<P>
A web server which supports PHP. PHP3 or PHP4 should work. Windows users
will be better off upgrading to the latest version of PHP4.

<P>
The <EM>mkGallery</EM> utility requires Perl and ImageMagick. See
<EM>docs/Utilities.txt</EM> for more information. Perl and ImageMagick are not required to use MiG
itself; they are only required if you want to use
<EM>mkGallery</EM> to create thumbnail images.

<P>
If you wish to extract embedded comments from JPEG files, you will also
need a C compiler (such as gcc) in order to build the (included) <EM>jhead</EM>
utility.

<H2><A NAME="INSTALLATION">INSTALLATION</A></H2>
<P>
Note: there are a lot of files in the <EM>docs</EM> subdirectory. For a basic installation, all you really have to read is <EM>INSTALL</EM>. The others are informative and you ought to read them to learn more about
what you can do, but they're not required reading just to install MiG and
get it working. You do need to read at least <EM>INSTALL</EM>.

<P>
For those who prefer HTML, there are HTML versions of all of the documents
in the <EM>docs/html</EM> directory.

<P>
Windows users should additionally refer to <EM>docs/Windows.txt</EM> for installation information.

<P>
PHP-Nuke users should read <EM>docs/phpNuke.txt</EM> for more information.

<P>
It's also a good idea to read <EM>docs/CHANGELOG</EM> to see what has changed recently, or just to get an idea of what MiG can do
and what its pitfalls might be.

<H2><A NAME="MAILING_LISTS">MAILING LISTS</A></H2>
<P>
There are two mailing lists related to MiG. Visit the URLs below if you
wish to subscribe. Both lists are currently fairly low-traffic.

<P>
mig-announce is an announcements-only list. New versions and so forth are
announced on this list.

<P>
mig-users is a general discussion list. Any mig-related topic can be
discussed on this list. Note also that I typically send announcements here,
so if you subscribe to mig-users you don't necessarily have to subscribe to
mig-announce as well (but you can if you want to).
