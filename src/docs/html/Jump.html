<P>
What is a jump tag? Well, many people (including the author) didn't like
the really long URLs that MiG uses because it made it clumsy to paste them
into an email, or a chat window, etc.

<P>
Jump tags were invented to address this problem. Take this URL for example:

<P>
<CODE>http://tangledhelix.com/gallery/index.php?pageType=folder&amp;currDir=./Our%20House/Before%20We%20Redecorated</CODE>



<P>
At 105 characters long, and having tons of URL-encoded <CODE>%xx</CODE> type things in it, it's not a pretty URL to have to send someone. But
here's what you can do. Add a line to your <EM>mig.cfg</EM> that adds to the Jump Map. There's an example of this in <EM>mig.cfg.default</EM>.

<P>
<PRE>    $jumpMap['example'] = 'currdir=./Example_Gallery';
</PRE>
<P>
That one goes to the example gallery. To go to the above URL is a little
more like this:

<P>
<PRE>    $jumpMap['house'] = 'currDir=./Our%20House/Before%20We%20Redecorated';
</PRE>
<P>
See, all I did here was copy the value of <CODE>currDir</CODE>. Then you can give out this URL instead:

<P>
<PRE>    <A HREF="http://tangledhelix.com/gallery/?jump=house">http://tangledhelix.com/gallery/?jump=house</A>
</PRE>
<P>
Much smaller and nicer. Imaging if you have albums four or five levels deep
(I know I do) and the URL gets pretty long. Hopefully this will address
that trouble.

<P>
You can do this in one of two ways, too. You can also use a URL like this:

<P>
<PRE>    <A HREF="http://tangledhelix.com/gallery/index.php/house">http://tangledhelix.com/gallery/index.php/house</A>
</PRE>
<P>
Which avoids clumsy stuff like the ? in the URL and such. It's a matter of
preference which one you use. Note that with the second method you can't
shorten it like this, though:

<P>
<PRE>    <A HREF="http://tangledhelix.com/gallery/house">http://tangledhelix.com/gallery/house</A>
</PRE>
<P>
Because the web server will look for that directory, not find it, and
return an error. So you have that <EM>index.php</EM> or <EM>index.php3</EM> stuck in there.

<P>
Granted, you have to maintain this mapping manually. But, no one is forcing
you to use it, either. :-)

<P>
This works with Apache web servers. I don't know if it works with anything
else. If you're running something other than Apache, let me know how you
fare with this feature.

Also see <EM>docs/Apache.txt</EM> which has some nifty <CODE>mod_rewrite</CODE> ideas to have simpler URLs.
