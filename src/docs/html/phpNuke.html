<P>
MiG has a ``PHP-Nuke Compatible'' mode which you can use to merge MiG into
your PHP-Nuke-based site. If you don't know what PHP-Nuke is, you probably
don't need to continue reading this file.

<P>
PHP-Nuke information can be found at <A
HREF="http://www.phpnuke.org/">http://www.phpnuke.org/</A>

<P>
Please read <EM>docs/INSTALL</EM> and then apply the following changes.

<P>
1. When the install script asks if you want to use PHP-Nuke, answer ``y''.

<P>
2. It will then make a few adjustments to customize to fit the PHP-Nuke way
of doing things.

<P>
3. When the install is finished, you will have a subdirectory <EM>mig</EM> in your main PHP-Nuke site directory. Everything related to MiG is stored
in that subdirectory, with one exception: <EM>mig.php</EM>. That is the script you will point to when linking to MiG. It then loads
the rest of its code from the <EM>mig</EM> subdirectory. That is done to make things cleaner so MiG doesn't litter
files all over your PHP-Nuke base directory.

<P>
4. You will need to copy the <EM>mig.cfg.default</EM> sample configuration from the <EM>mig</EM> subfolder into your PHP-Nuke root directory and call it
<EM>mig.cfg</EM>. In other words:

<P>
<PRE>    cd {php-nuke-root-directory}
    cp mig/mig.cfg.default ./mig.cfg
    vi mig.cfg
</PRE>
<P>
5. The <EM>mig.cfg</EM> file should already have the two things you absolutely need (<CODE>$phpNukeCompatible</CODE> and <CODE>$phpNukeRoot</CODE>). Tune the other parameters to whatever you see fit.

<P>
Make sure you can write to your phpNuke directory when installing. If not,
su to root, or log in as the user who owns the site prior to running the
install program.
