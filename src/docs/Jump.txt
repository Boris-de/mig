JUMP URL TAGS

  WHAT IS A JUMP URL TAG AND HOW DOES IT WORK?

    What is a jump tag? Well, many people (including the author)
    didn't like the really long URLs that MiG uses because it made
    it clumsy to paste them into an email, or a chat window, etc.

    Jump tags were invented to address this problem. Take this URL
    for example:

    `http://tangledhelix.com/gallery/index.php?pageType=folder&currD
    ir=./Our%20House/Before%20We%20Redecorated'

    At 105 characters long, and having tons of URL-encoded `%xx'
    type things in it, it's not a pretty URL to have to send
    someone. But here's what you can do. Add a line to your mig.cfg
    that adds to the Jump Map. There's an example of this in
    mig.cfg.default.

        $jumpMap['example'] = 'currdir=./Example_Gallery';

    That one goes to the example gallery. To go to the above URL is
    a little more like this:

        $jumpMap['house'] = 'currDir=./Our%20House/Before%20We%20Redecorated';

    See, all I did here was copy the value of `currDir'. Then you
    can give out this URL instead:

        http://tangledhelix.com/gallery/?jump=house

    Much smaller and nicer. Imaging if you have albums four or five
    levels deep (I know I do) and the URL gets pretty long.
    Hopefully this will address that trouble.

    You can do this in one of two ways, too. You can also use a URL
    like this:

        http://tangledhelix.com/gallery/index.php/house

    Which avoids clumsy stuff like the ? in the URL and such. It's a
    matter of preference which one you use. Note that with the
    second method you can't shorten it like this, though:

        http://tangledhelix.com/gallery/house

    Because the web server will look for that directory, not find
    it, and return an error. So you have that index.php or
    index.php3 stuck in there.

    Granted, you have to maintain this mapping manually. But, no one
    is forcing you to use it, either. :-)

    This works with Apache web servers. I don't know if it works
    with anything else. If you're running something other than
    Apache, let me know how you fare with this feature.

  TIPS FOR APACHE USERS

    Also see docs/Apache.txt which has some nifty `mod_rewrite'
    ideas to have simpler URLs.
