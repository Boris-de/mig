MIG CHANGE LOG

  Version 1.2.3 ()

    Removed install.bat, rewrote docs/Windows.txt to match.

    Rewrote install.sh for new directory layout (which was a side-
    effect of making Windows installs easier).

  Version 1.2.2 (Sun Apr 08 2001)

    Added language definition for Turkish

    Changed all occurrences of `$language' to `$mig_language'
    because of a suspected conflict with a variable name in PHP-
    Nuke.

  Version 1.2.1 (Fri Apr 06 2001)

    Fixed a bug where folks with `track_vars = Off' would break.

    Added definitions for Russian Windows-1251 and Russian KOI8-R

  Version 1.2 (Fri Apr 06 2001)

    Added `$suppressAltTags' to mig.cfg - when set to `TRUE', ALT
    tags are not added in thumbnail lists.

    Added `$useVirtual' in mig.cfg - when set to `FALSE',
    `virtual()' is not tried. This is for people who for some reason
    don't have `virtual()' support in their PHP installation.

    Fixed `printTemplate()' so it only fetches the image size if
    there's an image to fetch the size for. This had been causing a
    problem under some conditions.

    Added multi-language support (so far English and French
    translations). See the `$language' variable in mig.cfg.default.
    (Note this variable is known as `$mig_language' as of version
    1.2.2)

    Added `$sortType' to mig.cfg.default.

    Fixed bug that caused trouble with folks not using
    `register_globals'.

    Added definitions for German, Norwegian, Portugese, Finnish,
    Romanian.

  Version 1.1 (Thu Dec 28 2000)

    Added docs/Apache.txt with useful tips and tricks for Apache
    users.

    Added support for password-protected folders. See
    docs/Passwords.txt.

    Added support for thumbnail subdirectories. See
    docs/Install.txt, docs/Utilities.txt, and mig.cfg.default.

    Added code to accomodate sites using `magic_quotes_gpc'.

    Fixed bug with `PATH_INFO' jump tags.

    Added `$noThumbs' boolean to mig.cfg.default. See
    docs/Install.txt.

    Added `$thumbExt' to mig.cfg.default. See docs/Install.txt.

    Fixed bug in `parseMyConfig()' in mkGallery which caused a bad
    data set to be returned if the config file couldn't be read.

    Rewrote mkGallery to accomodate `$thumbExt'.

    Upgraded the bundled jhead distribution to 1.0. Updated
    install.sh and mkGallery to accomodate. No action on the part of
    users should be needed since the command-line syntax and output
    format of jhead is the same.

    (Duh!) Added Matthias Wendel (author of jhead) to
    docs/Credits.txt.

    Turned `magic_quotes_runtime' off by default - we don't do
    anything in a write mode and I don't see any advantage or safety
    offered by `magic_quotes' for this application.

    Using `$HTTP_GET_VARS' array now for people using
    `register_globals = Off'.

    Will start distributing .ZIP and .tar.gz formats from now on.

    Added `$maxThumbColumns' and `$maxFolderColumns' to
    mig.cfg.default. `$maxColumns', if present, will be used as the
    default value of `$maxThumbColumns'. This lets people use
    something other than a single column for folder listings.

  Version 1.0 (Wed Dec 06 2000)

    You can now type "quit" at any prompt during install.sh to
    abort.

    install.sh and PHP code revamped and retested for PHP-Nuke
    compatible mode. Now the MiG install (except for mig.php and
    mig.cfg) are sandboxed into the mig subdirectory rather than
    being right in the base PHP-Nuke directory.

    Changed mig.cfg.default to use `TRUE' & `FALSE' rather than 1
    and 0 for boolean options.

    Added `$suppressImageInfo' to mig.cfg.default - boolean option
    which controls whether to suppress the information printed below
    thumbnail images on thumbnail view pages.

  Version 0.99 (Thu Nov 16 2000)

    Not an enhancement, but I finally got around to trying out
    symlinks. Put a bit about this in docs/Install.txt.

    Added a new file docs/Credits.txt where I will credit folks who
    have contributed bits of code, found bugs, etc.

    Added PHP-Nuke compatibility mode (see docs/phpNuke.txt). Only
    of interest to folks using, or interested in using, PHP-Nuke.

    Updated install.sh for phpNuke mode, and tried to make it a
    little smarter about some things.

    Removed convert-metafiles from the main distribution and make it
    a contrib script instead. mf_conv.pl, too.

    Added the `PATH_INFO' method for Jump URLs. See docs/Jump.txt.

    Added -n and -r switches to mkGallery. See docs/Utilities.txt.

    Revamped `#include' for Apache users so it can execute CGI's
    too. See docs/Templates.txt.

    Fixed `buildNextPrevLinks()' to use an array as its return value
    instead of the (uglier) string concatenation method.

  Version 0.98 (Sun Nov 05 2000)

    Added jump URL tags. See docs/Jump.txt for more information.

  Version 0.97 (Sat Nov 04 2000)

    Fixed table formatting problem in `imageFrame()' which caused an
    extra cell to be printed which was visible as a small line in IE
    browsers.

  Version 0.96 (Thu Nov 02 2000)

    Updated docs/Install.txt with notes about file permissions.

    Fixed bug in `buildNextPrevLinks()' - it was ignoring <Sort>
    lists.

  Version 0.95 (Tue Oct 31 2000)

    Ran the example gallery through a `mogrify -quality 40' to
    reduce the size of the download tarball. Went from just over
    600KB to about 340KB. Amazingly, I can't even tell the
    difference viewing the images.

    Removed a hard-coded value from `buildImageURL()' which broke
    things for folks who had changed the value of `$albumDir'. It
    was found in three places inside that function.

    Made the terms of the licensing clearer according to the FSF GNU
    guidelines at http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html .

    Did a code review looking for potential problems, made minor
    adjustments.

    Added interactive (-i) mode to util/mkGallery. See
    docs/Utilities.txt.

    Happy Halloween!

  Version 0.94 (Sat Oct 28 2000)

    mkGallery will now sort items before handling them, so output
    files like the comment file will have items alphabetically (for
    simplicity).

    Fixed bug in `buildDirList()' that didn't do the rendering of
    spaces and underscores correctly (they should be rendered as
    `&nbsp;').

    Fixed rather large bug in `buildDirList()' which caused
    cascading links in the output HTML. This was not very noticeable
    until one had a large list of folders (where large is just a few
    tens of directories). A string was not being properly reset at
    the beginning of each loop iteration.

  Version 0.93 (Tue 17 Oct 2000)

    Added a question to install.sh which asks the user if they are
    upgrading from 0.83 or earlier (so not everyone for the rest of
    time has to run convert-metafiles anytime they upgrade).

    install.sh will no longer try to guess what directory to install
    into.

    Discovered that when moving from one page to the next, the
    `text-decoration' CSS property for anchors (<A> elements) was
    not reset. So if you set `text-decoration=none' it would
    memorize that and not go back to using underlines. So I defined
    `A:*' as having `text-decoration=underline' in
    templates/style.css (which is what you'd expect to see becaues
    most browsers underline links by default).

    Changed link on image view pages that goes back to read "back to
    thumbnail view". Previously it read "back to folder view" but it
    has been pointed out to me that the wording was confusing.

    Discovered the amazing function `GetImageSize()'. Now all
    thumbnail views will use `width= height=' for the thumbnails
    (this helps speed up the browser's rendering of tables), and
    thumbnail views now show the image size in both pixels and
    bytes. Single image views will use `width= height=' as well, to
    help the browser in its rendering task.

    Added new tag `%%imageSize%%' to the image.html template.

    Switched from using `$SCRIPT_NAME' to using `$PHP_SELF'. This
    basically means MiG should work for people using PHP's CGI mode
    now.

    Implemented <Sort> element in mig.cf - see docs/mig_cf.txt.

  Version 0.92 (Mon 02 Oct 2000)

    Plugged a security hole (`$currDir' wasn't being checked for
    '..') which let viewers see the entire directory stucture of a
    system. Anyone using anything prior to 0.92 should upgrade
    immediately!

  Version 0.91 (Sat 30 Sep 2000)

    Fixed a bug in mf_conv.pl which caused the comment conversion
    process to cascade itself... it stored a list of images and
    comments in memory, but when it entered a new directory it was
    not cleaning that out, so every mig.cf had comments for all the
    files in all the directories it had seen before. Not
    particularly dangerous but it litters your mig.cf files badly.
    This is only a problem for folks who upgraded from a release of
    MiG version 0.83 or earlier to MiG 0.90.

  Version 0.90 (Sat 30 Sep 2000)

    Created install.sh to act as an installer script. Reorganized
    the directory structure somewhat while doing this.

    Updated all documentation.

    Added the `#include' directive to the template processor. See
    the file docs/Templates.txt for information.

    Added Windows doc docs/Windows.txt for Windows users. Working on
    .EXE automatic-style installation program.

    Changed name of EXIF header cache file to exif.inf.

    Because install.sh checks for existing template files and tries
    to figure out the proper thing to do (asking for input if
    needed), hopefully the risk of the installation process blowing
    away customized templates has been eliminated (or at least
    reduced greatly). Well, unless you happen to use Windows, where
    I have less versatility with installation processes. See
    docs/Windows.txt for notes on that topic.

    Devised Apache-like format for meta file mig.cf which will hold
    comments, hidden file lists, etc. This will replace
    .comments.txt, .hidden.txt, etc. EXIF header info will still
    live in exif.inf (formerly known as .exif_comments.txt).
    Documentation is in docs/mig_cf.txt.

    Updated all files to reflect new domain "tangledhelix.com".

    Converted all colorization to use CSS stylesheets. However,
    Netscape doesn't behave regarding the `BODY' element and CSS,
    based on my tests. So there's a default color set in the `BODY'
    tag in the HTML templates. See the file docs/Templates.txt for
    more information.

    Added tag `%%distURL%%' for templates. Removed "MiG" from
    <TITLE> in the default templates.

    Added script convert-metafiles to convert metafiles to new
    format. It calls a Perl child process, mf_conv.pl.

    Installer tries to find Perl and if so, sets the #! line for
    Perl-based utility scripts. This is because folks have Perl
    installed in places that are hard to predict but which are
    probably in their `$PATH'.

    Added <Bulletin> feature to mig.cf. See docs/mig_cf.txt for
    info.

    "_" (underscore) is now rendered as a space character in the
    YouAreHere line as well as in the folder-list boxes.

    Got <Comment> working, got EXIF parsing working.

    Now in folder / thumbnail views, image comments are loaded as
    ALT tags, so they will pop-up as text when you hover over a
    link.

    Fixed bug which caused images with spaces in their filename to
    be handled improperly.

    Added `$markerType' and `$markerText' to mig.cfg.default. Added
    `-m' and `-M' flags to mkGallery. These were added to support
    customizable thumbnail naming conventions. You can now decide
    what thumbnail marker name to use (previously was forced to be
    "th". Also now you can declare it to be a prefix (as in
    "th_filename.JPG") or a suffix (as in "filename_th.JPG").
    Default will be as previous, suffix mode using "th" for
    filename_th.JPG. See docs/Utilities.txt and docs/Install.txt and
    mig.cfg.default for more information.

    Updated mkGallery to read `$markerType' and `$markerLabel' from
    mig.cfg, so you don't have to worry about the `-M' and `-m'
    flags as long as your mig.cfg has the right options set.

    Changed `slashFixedURLencode()' to `migURLencode()'.

    Fixed bug in `migURLencode()' where it would re-encode something
    which was already encoded resulting in a comma becoming `%252C'
    instead of say, `%2C'. It now runs input through
    `rawurldecode()' prior to doing a `rawurlencode()' on it.

    Added `-c' option to mkGallery - this will populate the mig.cf
    file with blank <Comment> elements. It was adapted from
    mkComments, which was contributed by André Fadel (fadel at
    fee.unicamp.br). See docs/Utilities.txt for information.

    Fixed bug in `getExifDescription()' which was returning
    incorrect values.

    Found bug in the convert-metafiles script which caused
    directories with spaces in the filename to wig the script out.
    Fixed.

    Fixed bug in regex used to find comment lines in
    `getExifDescription()' which would cause extremely long
    execution times when dealing with large exif.inf files.

    Fixed bug which caused improper display of filesizes in
    thumbnail views.

  Version 0.83 (Thu 24 Aug 2000)

    Images and folders are now sorted alphabetically, to make the
    sorting consistent, if not (yet) completely customizable.

  Version 0.82 (Thu 24 Aug 2000)

    Fixed bug in mkGallery that caused problems parsing filenames
    with embedded spaces.

  Version 0.81 (Sat 12 Aug 2000)

    Changed the behavior of `buildYouAreHere()' so the browser can't
    click on the current item - that is, the current folder or the
    current image. It just seemed silly to recreate the browser's
    reload button.

  Version 0.80 (Sat 12 Aug 2000)

    The pieces of the "you are here" headline are now clickable for
    simpler navigation between levels.

    Changed the style sheet so the links are underlined again.
    People aren't used to having it any other way, it was causing
    confusion.

    Got `newCurrDir' out of the URI string which makes the URL about
    50% as long as before. This entailed adding `getNewCurrDir()'
    calls.

  Version 0.77 (Sat 12 Aug 2000)

    Added style sheet support. See the file templates/style.css.

  Version 0.76 (Fri 11 Aug 2000)

    Rearranged the layout in image.html to make it friendlier for
    small screens.

  Version 0.75 (Tue 08 Aug 2000)

    Fixed overpadded image tables.

  Version 0.74 (Mon 07 Aug 2000)

    Cleaned up the HTML layout (mostly shuffling, adding, deleting
    <BR>).

  Version 0.73 (Mon 07 Aug 2000)

    Added a "now viewing #x of y" in image views, so the browser can
    easily tell how many images are left in either direction without
    returning to the thumbnail view.

  Version 0.72 (Mon 07 Aug 2000)

    Using colored table cells for comments now. Embedded comments
    are seperated from file-based comments with an <HR> element.

  Version 0.71 (Mon 07 Aug 2000)

    Descriptions are centered now.

  Version 0.70 (Mon 07 Aug 2000)

    Bundled jhead from Matthias Wandel in order to parse EXIF
    headers. jhead will be a child process of mkGallery when invoked
    with `-e'.

    Updated mkGallery with new options and code to handle parsing of
    EXIF headers using the jhead program. See the `-e' and `-w'
    options. Also added a `-t' option to specify if you should make
    thumbnails or not (since that's not the only action possible
    anymore).

    Added function `getExifDescription()' which parses the
    .exif_comments.txt files for embedded comments and displays them
    in image views. (This file is known as exif.inf as of the 0.90
    release)

  Version 0.61 (Sun 06 Aug 2000)

    Added "you are here" line, but it's not clickable yet.

  Version 0.60 (Sun 06 Aug 2000)

    Added "hidden" feature. Anything put into .hidden.txt in a
    directory will cause the listed items (one per line) to be
    rendered invisible. This is, of course, optional.

    Cleaned up places where `eregi()' or `eregi_replace()' were used
    when the proper call was `ereg()' or `ereg_replace()'.

    Added "comment" feature. Comments are stored in .comments.txt.
    See INSTALL for more information.

  Version 0.51 (Sun 06 Aug 2000)

    Added `$homeLink' and `$homeLabel' to config, to print a "back
    to {home}" link at the "root" folder level.

  Version 0.50 (Sat 05 Aug 2000)

    Set default colors so if `$imageBGcolor' and/or `$folderBGcolor'
    are missing in the config, it won't default to black.

    Set default `$maxColumns' in case that is omitted from config
    file.

    Set default `$title' in case that is omitted from config file.

    Set default `$maintAddr' in case that is omitted from config
    file.

    Got next/previous links working in image views

    Removed "back" link from "main" or "root" of album.

  Version 0.41 (Fri 04 Aug 2000)

    Fixed font size bug with back link on "main" page.

  Version 0.40 (Fri 04 Aug 2000)

    Rewrote mkGallery with `use strict' and `-w'

    Symlinked index.php3 to index.php for simplicity.

    Replaced "<<" in `buildBackLink()' with `&lt;&lt;' and cleaned
    up other such bits throughout the code.

    Replaced most spaces in templates & PHP with `&nbsp;' due to odd
    formatting problems with MSIE.

    Wrote table generation code into PHP and took it out of the
    template files due to MSIE's stupid insistence on displaying
    empty tables with a tiny colored square.

    Cleaned up (simplified) templates a little.

    Added variables `$imageBGcolor' and `$folderBGcolor', which are
    background colors for the table backgrounds for the image and
    folder tables, respectively. They can be found in
    mig.cfg.default.

    Documented templates in templates/README.templates. (This can
    now be found in docs/Templates.txt as of 0.90)

  Version 0.36 (Tue 01 Aug 2000)

    Got rid of `$phpExt' - include files aren't seen by the web
    server anyway, so the extension wasn't relevant.

  Version 0.35 (Tue 01 Aug 2000)

    Reworked page formatting. Now if there are no folders and no
    images present, the browser gets "No contents". If no folders,
    the folder table isn't printed. If no images, the images table
    isn't printed. If there are both, you see both tables. The
    result is less confusing.

    If mig.cfg is missing, mig.cfg.default will be read instead, to
    avoid any errors popping up.

  Version 0.34 (Mon 31 Jul 2000)

    Added a second back link to each page since pages can grow long
    enough that having one at the top and one at the bottom is
    desirable.

  Version 0.33 (Mon 31 Jul 2000)

    Added filesize to the thumbnails page

  Version 0.32 (Mon 31 Jul 2000)

    Fixed a stupid bug (`$maxColumns' was being ignored). Table
    layouts on thumbnail pages should work now.

  Version 0.31 (Mon 31 Jul 2000)

    If a thumbnail is missing, a generic image will be used in its
    place.

  Version 0.3 (Mon 31 Jul 2000)

    The "back" link is now grayed out when at the "main" page.

    Fixed bug in mkGallery that would cause it to create thumbnails
    of already-existing thumbnail images.

    Viewing a folder will now show the thumbnail images correctly.

    Added template image.html to view individual images.

    Removed the "you are at" headline, the help function, and the
    "exit" button. The latter two were never too useful, and the
    former is a real pain to get working. I'll save it for some
    future release.

    Added `$phpExt' variable for PHP3 users who might need filenames
    with `.php3' extensions instead of `.php'.

    Added `$pageTitle' to insert into the <TITLE> element of each
    template.

    Removed `*currLocation' routines

    Started using mig.cfg.default for dist bundles to avoid over-
    writing old config files.

    Fixed a bug which caused image view "back" links to go not to
    the previous page, but literally to "../"

    Fixed URL pointer in the HTML templates to reflect correct MiG
    distribution URL.

  Version 0.2 (Sun 30 Jul 2000)

    The mkGallery utility script is complete. Requires Perl and
    ImageMagick. No other significant changes in 0.2.

  Version 0.1 (Fri 28 Jul 2000)

    Got "any directory anywhere" directory browsing working
    correctly. An album can have any number of directories and
    subdirectories now. This is much better than the old 2-level
    directory model.

    Changed direction on the topic of thumbnail generation. It's
    better to pre-generate them instead of having the PHP code do it
    on the fly. Having the script get reliable write access to the
    filesystem proved to be a bit more sloppy than I originally
    thought.

    The old method of using numeric filenames is gone now (thank
    god).

    Support for JPEG/GIF/PNG formats should be good enough. Old
    model of supporting only one file type sucked.

    Nailed down an HTML layout finally, simpler than others I have
    seen, more attractive than the previous ones used in album.php3.

    Got HTML templates working.

    Added a help link, back link, and a mailto: link to each page.
    Each page also has a link back to the distribution URL.

    Got the "you are here" path to display, but no links yet.

    Got rid of the old problem from album.php3 where the path had to
    be statically set in the code ahead of time (and the fact that
    tilde-URLs like `/~dan/' didn't work). This time around the
    script figures out where it is in the filesystem and bases
    everything else on that path.

    Added the "exit" link to take browser to an outside URL.
