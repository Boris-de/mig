The contrib directory contains scripts and things that MiG users have
contributed back to the community.  They are for you to use and enjoy.

I make no guarantees about anything you find in the contrib directory.
Please exercise your own judgement before blindly using the things you
find here.  I will make an effort to validate them and make sure they
aren't blatantly destructive or anything, but I didn't write them and I
can't say for sure what they will or won't do for you.

If you have questions or comments on them, you can contact me, or the
author of the item in question (they should be identified in its contents)
or you can post to one of the MiG mailing lists.

They are provided as-is and you may need to adjust them slightly to work in
your particular environment.
