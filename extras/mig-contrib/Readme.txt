This package contains scripts and things that Mig users have contributed
back to the community.  They are for you to use and enjoy.

I make no guarantees about anything in this package.  Please exercise your
own judgement before blindly using them.  I will make an effort to validate
them and make sure they aren't blatantly destructive, but I didn't write
them (well, not all of them) and I can't say for sure what they will or
won't do.

If you have questions or comments on them, you can contact me, or the
author of the item in question (they should be identified in its contents)
or you can post to one of the Mig mailing lists.

They are provided as-is and you may need to adjust them slightly to work in
your particular environment.
