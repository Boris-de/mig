# Security Policy

## Supported versions

As releases only are made rarely and contain only small changes, updating is easy.
Therefore only the latest version of Mig is supported and will get security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report all possibly security relevant bugs and vulnerabilities via mail and encrypted with GPG.

You can find the current contact email at [/email.txt](https://mig.wcht.de/email.txt) on the webpage. Please note that
this address is rotated from time to time to avoid spam from crawlers.

The GPG public key can be found on [github](https://github.com/Boris-de.gpg)
or the webpage ([KEYS](https://mig.wcht.de/downloads/KEYS)).
