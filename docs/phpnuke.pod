=head2 Using Mig With PHP-Nuke

Mig has a PHP-Nuke compatibility mode which can be used to merge Mig into a
PHP-Nuke-based site.  If you don't know what PHP-Nuke is, you probably
don't need to continue reading this document.  More about PHP-Nuke can be
found at http://www.phpnuke.org/

(PHP-Nuke mode has not been tested with PHP-Nuke 5.x.  I have no idea if it
will work - use at your own risk.  It was last tested with PHP-Nuke 4.2.)

To install Mig on a PHP-Nuke site, read the F<install> document and then
apply the following changes.

=over 4

=item 1.

Instead of F<index.php>, name the main file F<mig.php> and put it in the
root directory of the PHP-Nuke installation.

=item 2.

Copy F<config.php> to the same directory.  Edit it and change
C<$phpNukeCompatible> to C<TRUE>.  Change C<$phpNukeRoot> to the root
directory of the PHP-Nuke installation.

=item 3.

Create a subdirectory called F<mig> in the PHP-Nuke root directory.  Put
all other Mig files there, as described in the F<install> document.

=item 4.

Ignore the F<templates> files that the F<install> document specifies.
Instead, copy over the files from the F<templates/phpnuke> directory into
the Mig F<templates> directory.  PHP-Nuke doesn't use the HTML templates
Mig normally uses, and it does not use the CSS file either.
