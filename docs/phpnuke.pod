=head2 Using Mig With PHP-Nuke

Mig has a E<quot>PHP-Nuke compatibleE<quot> mode which you can use to merge
Mig into your PHP-Nuke-based site.  If you don't know what PHP-Nuke is, you
probably don't need to continue reading this document.

PHP-Nuke information can be found at http://www.phpnuke.org/

(PHP-Nuke mode has not been tested with PHP-Nuke 5.x.  I have no idea if it
will work - use at you own risk.  It was last tested with PHP-Nuke 4.2.)

Please read the E<quot>installE<quot> document and then apply the following
changes.

=over 4

=item 1.

Instead of F<index.php>, name the main file mig.php and put it in the root
directory where your PHP-Nuke is installed.

=item 2.

Copy F<config.php> to the same place.  Edit it and change
C<$phpNukeCompatible> to C<TRUE>.  Change C<$phpNukeRoot> to point to the
root directory of your PHP-Nuke installation.

=item 3.

Create a subdirectory E<quot>migE<quot> in your PHP-Nuke root directory.
Put all other Mig files there, as described in the E<quot>installE<quot>
document.

=item 4.

Ignore the F<templates> files that the F<install> document specifies.
Instead, copy over the files from the F<templates/phpnuke> directory into
your Mig F<templates> directory.  PHP-Nuke doesn't use the HTML templates
Mig normally uses, and it does not use the CSS file either.
