=head2 PHP-Nuke, PostNuke and phpWebThings compatibility

Mig can be configured to try to fit into PHP-Nuke, PostNuke and
phpWebThings sites.

Find your PHP-Nuke, PostNuke or phpWebThings directory.  For example we'll
say this is F</www/mysite.com/nuke>

Create a subdirectory called F<mig> (i.e. F</www/mysite.com/nuke/mig>).
Put all the files into that folder as described in the F<install> document,
except for the following changes.

=over 4

=item 1.

Instead of the templates that the F<install> document mentions, copy over
the two files in F<templates/phpnuke>.  The HTML and CSS files Mig normally
uses are not used in Nuke mode.

=item 2.

Copy F<index.php> to your Nuke directory, not to the mig subdirectory.
And call it F<mig.php>, not F<index.php>.  Make sure you rename it before
you move it, so you do not over-write your Nuke's F<index.php> file.

=item 3.

Copy F<config.php.default> to F<config.php> in your Mig subdirectory,
if you don't already have one there.  Make sure you do not copy
F<config.php> into your Nuke directory, since Nuke has its own file called
F<config.php> and you must be careful not to destroy it.

=item 4.

Edit Mig's F<config.php> and set C<$phpNukeCompatible> to TRUE.
Change C<$phpNukeRoot> to your Nuke directory (i.e.
F</www/mysite.com/nuke>) - not the Mig directory, but your Nuke directory.

(If you're using phpWebThings, you want instead to set
C<$phpWebThingsCompatible> and C<$phpWebThingsRoot>).

=back

That should be it - http://yournukesite.com/mig.php should work.
