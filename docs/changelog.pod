=head2 MIG Change Log

=head2 Version 1.3.6 (NOT YET RELEASED)

Updated Danish, Italian and German translations.

Added Polish ISO-8859-2 translation (pliso).

Added E<lt>acronymE<gt> tag to files/folders counts.

Changed numeric character entities (i.e. E<amp>#225;) to alphabetic
references (i.e. E<amp>aacute;).

Upgraded included jhead distribution to version 1.8.

Added C<$ignoreDotDirectories> option to F<config.php>.

[Sourceforge bug report #589652] -
Fixed URL encoding bug in getRandomThumb()

[Sourceforge bug report #591337] -
Fixed bug in handling of E<lt>SortE<gt> and E<lt>HiddenE<gt>.  Previously
if an object was in a E<lt>SortE<gt> block, its status as a hidden item
would be ignored.  Objects marked as hidden are now hidden regardless of
how they are sorted.

Removed leading and trailing E<lt>STYLEE<gt> tags from
F<templates/style.css> - since Mig is using E<lt>LINKE<gt> to refer to the
style sheet now it was no longer necessary (and the W3C validator didn't
like it).  Fixed other minor HTML/CSS bugs.

Modified C<printTemplate()> to recognize SMB shares in Windows when
determining whether or not to prepend full path.

=head2 Version 1.3.5 (Sun, 07 Jul 2002)

Fixed bug in F<config.php> - the C<$pathConvert*> variables were
incorrectly named as C<$convertPath*> - Doh!

Fixed bug in C<FolderIcon> directive.  It had broken at some point and was
no longer properly pointing to the F<images> directory for icon files.

Fixed a bug where pre-sorted image lists would break pagination.

Added C<UseThumb> keyword to F<mig.cf> parser.

Applied a series of patches provided by H. Fox which are aimed at improving
HTML/XHTML compliance, and moving hard-coded HTML elements out of the PHP
code and into either CSS or template files.  Some table code cleanup was
done as well.  The three frame functions are gone and replaced by the
C<buildTable()> function.   Almost all E<lt>fontE<gt> tags have been
removed from the PHP code and replaced with other mechanisms in the
templates or CSS.  The layout is much cleaner now (IMO), however, anyone
upgrading from 1.3.4 or earlier and using the old templates, or their own
custom templates based on pre-1.3.5 template files, will not like the
changes.  I suggest everyone use the new templates, or re-do their
customizations based on the new templates and CSS.

Applied updated French translation from Yannick MassE<eacute>.

Added option C<$commentFileShortComments> to F<config.php>.

Added E<lt>ShortE<gt> tags to F<mig.cf> parser.

Added C<$showShortOnThumbPage> to F<config.php>.

Fixed bug in C<getNumberOfDirs()> where it was not properly handling
thumbnail subdirectories.

=head2 Version 1.3.4 (Tue, 11 Jun 2002)

Added Estonian and Japanese translations.

Fixed formatting issue in C<folderFrame()> (fix provided by Jan Jasinski).

Changed all occurrences of C<NULL> to empty strings.  Apparently C<NULL>
was not introduces until PHP4, so using C<NULL> was breaking PHP3
compatibility.

Added number of folders in addition to number of images when
C<$viewFolderCount> is C<TRUE>.

Fixed a bug in C<getImageDescFromFile()> where a comment would be
incompletely read if the file did not end with a newline character.

Added F<config.php> options C<$convertPathFlag>, C<$convertPathRegex>,
and C<$convertPathTarget> for cases where weird C<include_path> munging
is required.  See near the bottom of F<config.php.default>.

Added new F<config.php> options C<$imagePopLocationBar>,
C<$imagePopMenuBar>, and C<$imagePopToolBar> to control various toolbars
being visible or hidden in pop-up windows.

Added C<is_dir()> checks before all calls to C<opendir()>.

Modified comment behavior when using C<$commentFilePerImage = TRUE> so that
if a comment file is not present, the comment from F<mig.cf> will be used
(if one is present).

=head2 Version 1.3.3 (Mon, 27 May 2002)

Apparently I didn't document it in the changelog, but at some point I added
code to C<printTemplate()> to check for drive letters in the pathname to
the template file (as opposed to just looking for a leading / character).
This change was in the 1.3.2 release and possibly earlier.

Updated Danish translation with patch from Mikkel Kristensen.

Tested Nuke mode with PHPWebSite 0.8.2, works fine with no changes.
Updated F<phpnuke> document to reflect this.

Merged patch from Pawel Dylik to implement pagination of large galleries.
This resulted in the new F<config.php> option C<$maxThumbRows>, and a new
language element C<total_images> found in the language sets.  Right now,
there's a slight bug in this behavior.  If you click an image while on say,
page 2, then use the next-image link a bunch of times until you get to an
image that would be on page 3, if you then go back to thumbnail view, you
end up back on page 2.  For now I will let this sit, because fixing it
would require rewriting a lot of code for little real benefit.

Added code so the pagination now shows you which images you are viewing
(i.e. 21-40 of 49).

Added C<$randomFolderThumbs> to F<config.php>.  If C<TRUE>, a random
thumbnail from the folder will be used as the icon rather than the generic
folder icon (unless a C<FolderIcon> is set in F<mig.cf> - that takes
precedence).  If a given folder has no thumbs (i.e. it has only other
folders inside), Mig will traverse subdirectories until it finds a usable
thumbnail.  If it can't find one the generic folder icon is used instead.
(This was another Pawel patch.)

Added C<$folderNameLength> to F<config.php>.  When C<$randomFolderThumbs>
is C<TRUE>, folder names are truncated if they are longer than
C<$folderNameLength> characters (to help with table formatting).
(Another Pawel patch.)

=head2 Version 1.3.2 (Tue, 21 May 2002)

Some major changes this release - please pay attention!

Eliminated F<install.sh> - all installs are now done the same way (Windows,
unix, FTP, shell prompt, whatever).  Eliminated F<FTPinstall> and
F<Windows> documents since they are now redundant.  New installation
procedure is documented in the F<install> document.

PHP-Nuke mode was no longer working, so I fixed it.  While I was at it,
I added PostNuke and phpWebThings compatibility.  See the F<phpnuke>
document.  Tested with PHP-Nuke 5.5, PostNuke 0.714 and phpWebThings 0.41.
Added config variables C<$phpWebThingsCompatible> and C<$phpWebThingsRoot>
to F<config.php> for the new phpWebThings mode.

Changed language designation for Danish to E<quot>dkE<quot> instead of
E<quot>daE<quot> (I don't know what E<quot>daE<quot> is, but it's not
Denmark).

Removed F<Example Gallery> from main distribution.  It will be available
from this point forward as a separate package on the site.  There's no
reason for every Mig download to be almost half a meg (the 1.3.2b1 tar.gz
I built is under 150K).

Added C<MaintAddr> object to F<mig.cf> parser (thanks to Simon Wood for
supplying this code!).  This permits you to change the value of
C<$maintAddr> on a per-folder basis if desired.

Fixed regex bug that caused the exposure time (from EXIF data) to be
incorrectly reported in some circumstances.

General cleanup of documentation.

Modified F<mkGallery.pl> to look for F<jhead> in E<quot>.E<quot> - simplifies
the task of finding it.

Entirely restructured the CVS tree.  When the smoke cleared, F<funcs.php>
and F<lang.php> had vanished (merged into F<index.php>).  Mig is just one
file now (well, the PHP code is anyway), plus a config file written in PHP.

Eliminated C<$useVirtual> - it was not being used by C<printTemplate()>
anymore.

Modified F<mkGallery.pl> to use thumbnail subdirectories by default.

Added C<-f> flag to F<mkGallery.pl>, so one can specify the path to the
F<config.php> file if so desired.

Deprecated the C<$viewCamInfo> and C<$viewDateInfo> options.  Everything
related to EXIF formatting is now controlled by the C<$exifFormatString>
variable found in F<config.php>.  Information on how to use it can be found
in F<config.php.default>.

=head2 Version 1.3.1 (Tue, 07 May 2002)

[Sourceforge bug report #467122] -
Fixed sorting bug (if C<$sortType> was set to anything other than
C<default>, the thumbnails would be sorted, but the images would
actually be out of order as far as the next/previous links were
concerned.  Turns out the sorting had made it into C<buildImageList()>
but not C<buildNextPrevLinks()>.

[Sourceforge bug report #512980] -
Removed two extraneous arguments in a call to C<printTemplate()>.
This hadn't caused me any trouble, but if C<error_reporting> was set
to include C<E_NOTICE>, errors would be generated.

[Sourceforge feature request #521109] -
Now when invoked with C<-c>, F<mkGallery> will also add a E<lt>BulletinE<gt>
tag to F<mig.cf>.  In interactive mode it will ask the user for the
bulletin text, otherwise it will just create an empty bulletin.

[Sourceforge feature request #521032] -
Added new config variable C<$commentFilePerImage> (default C<FALSE>).
When set to C<TRUE>, Mig looks for comments in a separate file for
each image rather than looking for all comments in F<mig.cf>.  For
example if you have F<IMG_4900.JPG>, Mig would look at F<IMG_4900.txt>
for the comment.  Unlike F<mig.cf>, a comment in one of these files
does not need to be enclosed in a E<lt>CommentE<gt> block.  The entire
file is used as the comment.  Mig will strip newlines and tabs out.
When C<$commentFilePerImage> is C<FALSE>, normal processing of comments
using the F<mig.cf> file happens.

Changed filename of configuration file from F<mig.cfg> to F<config.php>.
This is simply to avoid having people rummaging through your config with
their web browser.  The install script will attempt to handle this
gracefully for you, or you can just rename files yourself.

Changed default value of C<$useThumbSubdir> to TRUE.  Changed example
gallery to match.

Upgraded jhead to version 1.6.

=head2 Version 1.3.0 (Tue, 23 Apr 2002)

Added E<lt>TITLEE<gt> tags in thumbnail views so when hovering over a
thumbnail, you get the comment whether using Mozilla/Gecko/Netscape or
Internet Explorer.  C<$suppressAltTags> will also suppress the
E<lt>TITLEE<gt> tags.

Added Polish translation.

Replaced Italian translation with cleaner one from Marco Ermini.

Added date/time stamp parsing to C<getExifDescription()>.  This can be
activated by setting C<$viewDateInfo> to C<TRUE> in F<mig.cfg>.
(It is C<FALSE> by default).

Changed C<getExifDescription()> formatting slightly.
Changed f-stop display to omit any '/' if present.

=head2 Version 1.2.9 (Thu, 16 Aug 2001)

Added C<$imagePopup> and C<$imagePopType> to F<mig.cfg.default>.  Using these
one can have pop-up windows enabled.  See F<docs/INSTALL>.

[Sourceforge bug report #441188] -
Fixed a bug in the handling of C<$viewFolderCount>.  Previously, if a
folder was mentioned in a E<lt>sortE<gt> block, it would be ignored when
C<$viewFolderCount> was evaluated.  Now C<$viewFolderCount> is properly
applied to all folders that contain images, whether they are sorted or
not.

[Sourceforge bug report #442760] -
Fixed a bug in C<getExifDescription()>.  The string C<flash used>
was hard-coded rather than being included in the language library.

Upgraded to most recent revision of jhead to get ISO rating support.

Added ISO rating to EXIF info parser.

Fixed bug in ALT tag (there was no space before the SRC and ALT bits).

=head2 Version 1.2.8 (Fri, 29 Jun 2001)

Added Italian and Spanish translations.

[Sourceforge feature request #416337] - 
Modified the ALT tag code such that HTML entities within E<lt>commentE<gt>
blocks should be OK now even if hover-over comments are being used
in thumbnail views.

Added Slovak and Dutch translations.

[Sourceforge feature request #414831] -
Added C<$viewCamInfo> to F<mig.cfg.default>.  If set to C<TRUE> and an
F<exif.inf> is present in a given gallery folder, it will be read to try to
extract camera model, and frame exposure information for display on the
page.

[Sourceforge feature request #424166] -
Added C<$viewFolderCount> to F<mig.cfg.default>.  If set to C<TRUE>, the
number of images in a given folder will be displayed next to the folder's
name in parentheses, in a folder list view.

[Sourceforge feature request #414827] -
Added C<FolderIcon> entity to F<mig.cf> parser.  Lets you define something
other than F<folder.gif> as the icon for a folder.  You can define each
folder with any icon you want.  Default is still F<folder.gif>.

[Sourceforge feature request #414827] -
Added C<FolderTemplate> entity to F<mig.cf> parser.  This allows for a
template file to be defined within the folder itself, specific to that
folder.  Or you can define a full path if you wanted.

[Sourceforge feature request #414827] -
Added C<PageTitle> entity to F<mig.cf> parser.  Allows for a per-folder
pageTitle to be set.

[Sourceforge feature request #414827] -
Added C<MaxFolderColumns> and C<MaxThumbColumns> entities to F<mig.cf>
parser.  This permits custom column settings per folder.

=head2 Version 1.2.7p1 (Sun, 15 Apr 2001)

Fixed bug from 1.2.7 which caused images to show up as folders when both
folders and images were present.

=head2 Version 1.2.7 (Sat, 14 Apr 2001)

Added Danish translation.

Modified template parser so that you can use C<#include> to include PHP
files (files with extensions C<.php> or C<.php3>).

Added F<docs/FTPinstall.txt> for people who have only FTP access to their
server and no shell access (i.e. they can't run F<install.sh>).

Streamlined code where possible.

Got rid of repeated parses of F<mig.cf> in subroutines and created
C<parseMigCf()> to just do it once to save time and effort on file I/O.

=head2 Version 1.2.4 (Mon, 09 Apr 2001)

Added Swedish translation.

Removed all calls to C<die()> since they seemed to not work in all versions
of PHP.

=head2 Version 1.2.3 (Mon, 09 Apr 2001)

Removed F<install.bat>, rewrote F<docs/Windows.txt> to match.

Rewrote F<install.sh> for new directory layout (which was a side-effect of
making Windows installs easier).

Adjusted all server variables so that things should work whether
C<register_globals> or C<track_vars> are in use (or both).

Found a hard-coded directory in C<printTemplate()> - corrected.

=head2 Version 1.2.2 (Sun, 08 Apr 2001)

Added language definition for Turkish.

Changed all occurrences of C<$language> to C<$mig_language> because of a
suspected conflict with a variable name in PHP-Nuke.

=head2 Version 1.2.1 (Fri, 06 Apr 2001)

Fixed a bug where folks with C<track_vars = Off> would break.

Added translations for Russian Windows-1251 and Russian KOI8-R.

=head2 Version 1.2 (Fri, 06 Apr 2001)

Added C<$suppressAltTags> to F<mig.cfg> - when set to C<TRUE>, ALT tags are
not added in thumbnail lists.

Added C<$useVirtual> in F<mig.cfg> - when set to C<FALSE>, C<virtual()> is
not tried.  This is for people who for some reason don't have C<virtual()>
support in their PHP installation.

Fixed C<printTemplate()> so it only fetches the image size if there's an
image to fetch the size for.  This had been causing a problem under some
conditions.

Added multi-language support (so far English and French translations).  See
the C<$language> variable in F<mig.cfg.default>.

Added C<$sortType> to F<mig.cfg.default>.

Fixed bug that caused trouble with folks not using C<register_globals>.

Added translations for German, Norwegian, Portugese, Finnish, Romanian.

=head2 Version 1.1 (Thu, 28 Dec 2000)

Added F<docs/Apache.txt> with useful tips and tricks for Apache users.

Added support for password-protected folders.  See F<docs/Passwords.txt>.

Added support for thumbnail subdirectories.  See F<docs/Install.txt>,
F<docs/Utilities.txt>, and F<mig.cfg.default>.

Added code to accomodate sites using C<magic_quotes_gpc>.

Fixed bug with C<PATH_INFO> jump tags.

Added C<$noThumbs> boolean to F<mig.cfg.default>.  See F<docs/Install.txt>.

Added C<$thumbExt> to F<mig.cfg.default>.  See F<docs/Install.txt>.

Fixed bug in C<parseMyConfig()> in F<mkGallery> which caused a bad data set
to be returned if the config file couldn't be read.

Rewrote F<mkGallery> to accomodate C<$thumbExt>.

Upgraded the bundled F<jhead> distribution to 1.0.  Updated F<install.sh>
and F<mkGallery> to accomodate.  No action on the part of users should be
needed since the command-line syntax and output format of F<jhead> is the
same.

(Duh!)  Added Matthias Wendel (author of F<jhead>) to F<docs/Credits.txt>.

Turned C<magic_quotes_runtime> off by default - we don't do anything in a
write mode and I don't see any advantage or safety offered by
C<magic_quotes> for this application.

Using C<$HTTP_GET_VARS> array now for people using C<register_globals = Off>.

Will start distributing .ZIP and .tar.gz formats from now on.

Added C<$maxThumbColumns> and C<$maxFolderColumns> to F<mig.cfg.default>.
C<$maxColumns>, if present, will be used as the default value of
C<$maxThumbColumns>.  This lets people use something other than a single
column for folder listings.

=head2 Version 1.0 (Wed, 06 Dec 2000)

You can now type E<quot>quitE<quot> at any prompt during F<install.sh> to
abort.

F<install.sh> and PHP code revamped and retested for PHP-Nuke compatible
mode.  Now the Mig install (except for F<mig.php> and F<mig.cfg>) are
sandboxed into the F<mig> subdirectory rather than being right in the base
PHP-Nuke directory.

Changed F<mig.cfg.default> to use C<TRUE> & C<FALSE> rather than 1 and 0
for boolean options.

Added C<$suppressImageInfo> to F<mig.cfg.default> - boolean option which
controls whether to suppress the information printed below thumbnail images
on thumbnail view pages.

=head2 Version 0.99 (Thu, 16 Nov 2000)

Not an enhancement, but I finally got around to trying out symlinks.  Put a
bit about this in F<docs/Install.txt>.

Added a new file F<docs/Credits.txt> where I will credit folks who have
contributed bits of code, found bugs, etc.

Added PHP-Nuke compatibility mode (see F<docs/phpNuke.txt>).  Only of
interest to folks using, or interested in using, PHP-Nuke.

Updated F<install.sh> for phpNuke mode, and tried to make it a little
smarter about some things.

Removed F<convert-metafiles> from the main distribution and make it a
contrib script instead.  F<mf_conv.pl>, too.

Added the C<PATH_INFO> method for Jump URLs.  See F<docs/Jump.txt>.

Added C<-n> and C<-r> switches to F<mkGallery>.  See F<docs/Utilities.txt>.

Revamped C<#include> for Apache users so it can execute CGI's too.  See
F<docs/Templates.txt>.

Fixed C<buildNextPrevLinks()> to use an array as its return value instead
of the (uglier) string concatenation method.

=head2 Version 0.98 (Sun, 05 Nov 2000)

Added jump URL tags.  See F<docs/Jump.txt> for more information.

=head2 Version 0.97 (Sat, 04 Nov 2000)

Fixed table formatting problem in C<imageFrame()> which caused an extra
cell to be printed which was visible as a small line in IE browsers.

=head2 Version 0.96 (Thu, 02 Nov 2000)

Updated F<docs/Install.txt> with notes about file permissions.

Fixed bug in C<buildNextPrevLinks()> - it was ignoring E<lt>SortE<gt>
lists.

Happy birthday, Katie!

=head2 Version 0.95 (Tue, 31 Oct 2000)

Ran the example gallery through a C<mogrify -quality 40> to reduce the size
of the download tarball.  Went from just over 600KB to about 340KB.
Amazingly, I can't even tell the difference viewing the images.

Removed a hard-coded value from C<buildImageURL()> which broke things for
folks who had changed the value of C<$albumDir>.

Made the terms of the licensing clearer according to the FSF GNU
guidelines at http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html .

Did a code review looking for potential problems, made minor adjustments.

Added interactive (-i) mode to F<util/mkGallery>.  See
F<docs/Utilities.txt>.

Happy Halloween!

=head2 Version 0.94 (Sat, 28 Oct 2000)

F<mkGallery> will now sort items before handling them, so output files like
the comment file will have items alphabetically (for simplicity).

Fixed bug in C<buildDirList()> that didn't do the rendering of spaces and
underscores correctly (they should be rendered as C<&nbsp;>).

Fixed bug in C<buildDirList()> which caused cascading links in the output
HTML.  This was not very noticeable until one had a large list of folders
(where large is just a few tens of directories).  A string was not being
properly reset at the beginning of each loop iteration.

=head2 Version 0.93 (Tue, 17 Oct 2000)

Added a question to F<install.sh> which asks the user if they are upgrading
from 0.83 or earlier (so not everyone for the rest of time has to run
F<convert-metafiles> anytime they upgrade).

F<install.sh> will no longer try to guess what directory to install into.

Discovered that when moving from one page to the next, the
C<text-decoration> CSS property for anchors (E<lt>AE<gt> elements) was not
reset.  So if you set C<text-decoration=none> it would memorize that and
not go back to using underlines.  So I defined C<A:*> as having
C<text-decoration=underline> in F<templates/style.css> (which is what you'd
expect to see becaues most browsers underline links by default).

Changed link on image view pages that goes back to read E<quot>back to
thumbnail viewE<quot>.  Previously it read E<quot>back to folder
viewE<quot> but it has been pointed out to me that the wording was
confusing.

Discovered the amazing function C<GetImageSize()>.  Now all thumbnail views
will use C<width= height=> for the thumbnails (this helps speed up the
browser's rendering of tables), and thumbnail views now show the image size
in both pixels and bytes.  Single image views will use C<width= height=> as
well, to help the browser in its rendering task.

Added new tag C<%%imageSize%%> to the F<image.html> template.

Switched from using C<$SCRIPT_NAME> to using C<$PHP_SELF>.  This basically
means Mig should work for people using PHP's CGI mode now.

Implemented E<lt>SortE<gt> element in F<mig.cf> - see F<docs/mig_cf.txt>.

=head2 Version 0.92 (Mon, 02 Oct 2000)

Plugged a security hole (C<$currDir> wasn't being checked for '..') which
let viewers see the entire directory stucture of a system.  Anyone using
anything prior to 0.92 should upgrade immediately!

=head2 Version 0.91 (Sat, 30 Sep 2000)

Fixed a bug in F<mf_conv.pl> which caused the comment conversion process to
cascade itself... it stored a list of images and comments in memory, but
when it entered a new directory it was not cleaning that out, so every
F<mig.cf> had comments for all the files in all the directories it had seen
before.  Not particularly dangerous but it litters your F<mig.cf> files
badly.  This is only a problem for folks who upgraded from a release of Mig
version 0.83 or earlier to Mig 0.90.

=head2 Version 0.90 (Sat, 30 Sep 2000)

Created F<install.sh> to act as an installer script.  Reorganized the
directory structure somewhat while doing this.

Updated all documentation.

Added the C<#include> directive to the template processor.  See the file
F<docs/Templates.txt> for information.

Added Windows doc F<docs/Windows.txt> for Windows users.  Working on .EXE
automatic-style installation program.

Changed name of EXIF header cache file to F<exif.inf>.

Because F<install.sh> checks for existing template files and tries to
figure out the proper thing to do (asking for input if needed), hopefully
the risk of the installation process blowing away customized templates has
been eliminated (or at least reduced greatly).  Well, unless you happen to
use Windows, where I have less versatility with installation processes.
See F<docs/Windows.txt> for notes on that topic.

Devised Apache-like format for meta file F<mig.cf> which will hold
comments, hidden file lists, etc.  This will replace F<.comments.txt>,
F<.hidden.txt>, etc.  EXIF header info will still live in F<exif.inf>
(formerly known as F<.exif_comments.txt>).  Documentation is in
F<docs/mig_cf.txt>.

Updated all files to reflect new domain E<quot>tangledhelix.comE<quot>.

Converted all colorization to use CSS stylesheets.  However, Netscape
doesn't behave regarding the C<BODY> element and CSS, based on my tests.
So there's a default color set in the C<BODY> tag in the HTML templates.
See the file F<docs/Templates.txt> for more information.

Added tag C<%%distURL%%> for templates.  Removed E<quot>MigE,<quot> from
E<lt>TITLEE<gt> in the default templates.

Added script F<convert-metafiles> to convert metafiles to new format.
It calls a Perl child process, F<mf_conv.pl>.

Installer tries to find Perl and if so, sets the #! line for Perl-based
utility scripts.  This is because folks have Perl installed in places that
are hard to predict but which are probably in their C<$PATH>.

Added E<lt>BulletinE<gt> feature to F<mig.cf>.  See F<docs/mig_cf.txt> for
info.

E<quot>_E<quot> (underscore) is now rendered as a space character in the
YouAreHere line as well as in the folder-list boxes.

Got E<lt>CommentE<gt> working, got EXIF parsing working.

Now in folder / thumbnail views, image comments are loaded as ALT tags,
so they will pop-up as text when you hover over a link.

Fixed bug which caused images with spaces in their filename to be handled
improperly.

Added C<$markerType> and C<$markerText> to F<mig.cfg.default>.  Added C<-m>
and C<-M> flags to F<mkGallery>.  These were added to support customizable
thumbnail naming conventions.  You can now decide what thumbnail marker
name to use (previously was forced to be E<quot>thE<quot>.  Also now you
can declare it to be a prefix (as in E<quot>th_filename.JPGE<quot>) or a
suffix (as in E<quot>filename_th.JPGE<quot>).  Default will be as previous,
suffix mode using E<quot>thE<quot> for filename_th.JPG.  See
F<docs/Utilities.txt> and F<docs/Install.txt> and F<mig.cfg.default> for
more information.

Updated F<mkGallery> to read C<$markerType> and C<$markerLabel> from
F<mig.cfg>, so you don't have to worry about the C<-M> and C<-m> flags as
long as your F<mig.cfg> has the right options set.

Changed C<slashFixedURLencode()> to C<migURLencode()>.

Fixed bug in C<migURLencode()> where it would re-encode something which was
already encoded resulting in a comma becoming C<%252C> instead of say,
C<%2C>.  It now runs input through C<rawurldecode()> prior to doing a
C<rawurlencode()> on it.

Added C<-c> option to F<mkGallery> - this will populate the F<mig.cf> file
with blank E<lt>CommentE<gt> elements.  It was adapted from F<mkComments>,
which was contributed by André Fadel (fadel at fee.unicamp.br).  See
F<docs/Utilities.txt> for information.

Fixed bug in C<getExifDescription()> which was returning incorrect values.

Found bug in the F<convert-metafiles> script which caused directories with
spaces in the filename to wig the script out.  Fixed.

Fixed bug in regex used to find comment lines in C<getExifDescription()>
which would cause extremely long execution times when dealing with large
F<exif.inf> files.

Fixed bug which caused improper display of filesizes in thumbnail views.

=head2 Version 0.83 (Thu, 24 Aug 2000)

Images and folders are now sorted alphabetically, to make the sorting
consistent, if not (yet) completely customizable.

=head2 Version 0.82 (Thu, 24 Aug 2000)

Fixed bug in F<mkGallery> that caused problems parsing filenames with
embedded spaces.

=head2 Version 0.81 (Sat, 12 Aug 2000)

Changed the behavior of C<buildYouAreHere()> so the browser can't click on
the current item - that is, the current folder or the current image.  It
just seemed silly to recreate the browser's reload button.

=head2 Version 0.80 (Sat, 12 Aug 2000)

The pieces of the E<quot>you are hereE<quot> headline are now clickable for
simpler navigation between levels.

Changed the style sheet so the links are underlined again.  People aren't
used to having it any other way, it was causing confusion.

Got C<newCurrDir> out of the URI string which makes the URL about 50% as
long as before.  This entailed adding C<getNewCurrDir()> calls.

=head2 Version 0.77 (Sat, 12 Aug 2000)

Added style sheet support.  See the file F<templates/style.css>.

=head2 Version 0.76 (Fri, 11 Aug 2000)

Rearranged the layout in F<image.html> to make it friendlier for small
screens.

=head2 Version 0.75 (Tue, 08 Aug 2000)

Fixed overpadded image tables.

=head2 Version 0.74 (Mon, 07 Aug 2000)

Cleaned up the HTML layout (mostly shuffling, adding, deleting
E<lt>BRE<gt>).

=head2 Version 0.73 (Mon, 07 Aug 2000)

Added a E<quot>now viewing #x of yE<quot> in image views, so the browser
can easily tell how many images are left in either direction without
returning to the thumbnail view.

=head2 Version 0.72 (Mon, 07 Aug 2000)

Using colored table cells for comments now.  Embedded comments are
seperated from file-based comments with an E<lt>HRE<gt> element.

=head2 Version 0.71 (Mon, 07 Aug 2000)

Descriptions are centered now.

=head2 Version 0.70 (Mon, 07 Aug 2000)

Bundled F<jhead> from Matthias Wandel in order to parse EXIF headers.
F<jhead> will be a child process of F<mkGallery> when invoked with C<-e>.

Updated F<mkGallery> with new options and code to handle parsing of EXIF
headers using the F<jhead> program.  See the C<-e> and C<-w> options.  Also
added a C<-t> option to specify if you should make thumbnails or not (since
that's not the only action possible anymore).

Added function C<getExifDescription()> which parses the
F<.exif_comments.txt> files for embedded comments and displays them in
image views.

=head2 Version 0.61 (Sun, 06 Aug 2000)

Added E<quot>you are hereE<quot> line, but it's not clickable yet.

=head2 Version 0.60 (Sun, 06 Aug 2000)

Added E<quot>hiddenE<quot> feature.  Anything put into F<.hidden.txt> in a
directory will cause the listed items (one per line) to be rendered
invisible.  This is, of course, optional.

Cleaned up places where C<eregi()> or C<eregi_replace()> were used when the
proper call was C<ereg()> or C<ereg_replace()>.

Added E<quot>commentE<quot> feature.  Comments are stored in
F<.comments.txt>.  See F<INSTALL> for more information.

=head2 Version 0.51 (Sun, 06 Aug 2000)

Added C<$homeLink> and C<$homeLabel> to config, to print a E<quot>back to
{home}E<quot> link at the E<quot>rootE<quot> folder level.

=head2 Version 0.50 (Sat, 05 Aug 2000)

Set default colors so if C<$imageBGcolor> and/or C<$folderBGcolor> are
missing in the config, it won't default to black.

Set default C<$maxColumns> in case that is omitted from config file.

Set default C<$title> in case that is omitted from config file.

Set default C<$maintAddr> in case that is omitted from config file.

Got next/previous links working in image views.

Removed E<quot>backE<quot> link from E<quot>mainE<quot> or
E<quot>rootE<quot> of album.

=head2 Version 0.41 (Fri, 04 Aug 2000)

Fixed font size bug with back link on E<quot>mainE<quot> page.

=head2 Version 0.40 (Fri, 04 Aug 2000)

Rewrote F<mkGallery> with C<use strict> and C<-w>.

Symlinked F<index.php3> to F<index.php> for simplicity.

Replaced E<quot>E<lt>E<lt>E<quot> in C<buildBackLink()> with C<&lt;&lt;>
and cleaned up other such bits throughout the code.

Replaced most spaces in templates & PHP with C<&nbsp;> due to odd
formatting problems with MSIE.

Wrote table generation code into PHP and took it out of the template files
due to MSIE's stupid insistence on displaying empty tables with a tiny
colored square.

Cleaned up (simplified) templates a little.

Added variables C<$imageBGcolor> and C<$folderBGcolor>, which are
background colors for the table backgrounds for the image and folder
tables, respectively.  They can be found in F<mig.cfg.default>.

Documented templates in F<templates/README.templates>.

=head2 Version 0.36 (Tue, 01 Aug 2000)

Got rid of C<$phpExt> - include files aren't seen by the web server anyway,
so the extension wasn't relevant.

=head2 Version 0.35 (Tue, 01 Aug 2000)

Reworked page formatting.  Now if there are no folders and no images
present, the browser gets E<quot>No contentsE<quot>.  If no folders, the
folder table isn't printed.  If no images, the images table isn't printed.
If there are both, you see both tables.  The result is less confusing.

If F<mig.cfg> is missing, F<mig.cfg.default> will be read instead, to avoid
any errors popping up. 

=head2 Version 0.34 (Mon, 31 Jul 2000)

Added a second back link to each page since pages can grow long enough that
having one at the top and one at the bottom is desirable.

=head2 Version 0.33 (Mon, 31 Jul 2000)

Added filesize to the thumbnails page.

=head2 Version 0.32 (Mon, 31 Jul 2000)

Fixed a stupid bug (C<$maxColumns> was being ignored).  Table layouts on
thumbnail pages should work now.

=head2 Version 0.31 (Mon, 31 Jul 2000)

If a thumbnail is missing, a generic image will be used in its place.

=head2 Version 0.3 (Mon, 31 Jul 2000)

The E<quot>backE<quot> link is now grayed out when at the
E<quot>mainE<quot> page.

Fixed bug in F<mkGallery> that would cause it to create thumbnails of
already-existing thumbnail images.

Viewing a folder will now show the thumbnail images correctly.

Added template F<image.html> to view individual images.

Removed the E<quot>you are atE<quot> headline, the help function, and the
E<quot>exitE<quot> button.  The latter two were never too useful, and the
former is a real pain to get working.  I'll save it for some future
release.

Added C<$phpExt> variable for PHP3 users who might need filenames with
C<.php3> extensions instead of C<.php>.

Added C<$pageTitle> to insert into the E<lt>TITLEE<gt> element of each
template.

Removed C<*currLocation> routines.

Started using F<mig.cfg.default> for dist bundles to avoid over-writing old
config files.

Fixed a bug which caused image view E<quot>backE<quot> links to go not to
the previous page, but literally to E<quot>../E<quot>.

Fixed URL pointer in the HTML templates to reflect correct Mig distribution
URL.

=head2 Version 0.2 (Sun, 30 Jul 2000)

The F<mkGallery> utility script is complete.  Requires Perl and
ImageMagick.  No other significant changes in 0.2.

=head2 Version 0.1 (Fri, 28 Jul 2000)

Got E<quot>any directory anywhereE<quot> directory browsing working
correctly.  An album can have any number of directories and subdirectories
now.  This is much better than the old 2-level directory model.

Changed direction on the topic of thumbnail generation.  It's better to
pre-generate them instead of having the PHP code do it on the fly.  Having
the script get reliable write access to the filesystem proved to be a bit
more sloppy than I originally thought.

The old method of using numeric filenames is gone now (thank god).

Support for JPEG/GIF/PNG formats should be good enough.  Old model of
supporting only one file type sucked.

Nailed down an HTML layout finally, simpler than others I have seen, more
attractive than the previous ones used in F<album.php3>.

Got HTML templates working.

Added a help link, back link, and a mailto: link to each page.  Each page
also has a link back to the distribution URL.

Got the E<quot>you are hereE<quot> path to display, but no links yet.

Got rid of the old problem from F<album.php3> where the path had to be
statically set in the code ahead of time (and the fact that tilde-URLs like
C</~dan/> didn't work).  This time around the script figures out where it
is in the filesystem and bases everything else on that path.

Added the E<quot>exitE<quot> link to take browser to an outside URL.
