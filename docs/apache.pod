=head2 Mig and the Apache Server

=head2 Security Considerations

There are always security considerations when dealing with anonymous
external users accessing your system and data.  Mig mitigates these
concerns where it can (for instance, a C<currDir> variable containing
E<quot>..E<quot> causes Mig to panic and immediately exit), but it can't do
everything.

The main thing Mig does to help with the security problem is that it never,
ever, writes anything to the disk.  It only reads.  This minimizes the
potential damage a malicious attacker could do.

An example: Mig's PHP code can't control whether or not a web user fetches
your F<mig.cf> or F<exif.inf> files and so forth by simply using direct
URLs.  Users of Apache can use the following in their configuration to get
around this limitation:

    <Directory /path/to/your/mig/gallery>
        # Protect against anyone trying to view a mig.cf file
        <Files ~ "^mig.cf$">
            order allow,deny
            deny from all
        </Files>
        # Protect against anyone trying to view exif.inf files
        <Files ~ "^exif.inf$">
            order allow,deny
            deny from all
        </Files>
    </Directory>

With these rules in place, someone can't for example go to a URL like:

    http://tangledhelix.com/gallery/albums/Miscellaneous/mig.cf

to see that file.  It would be met with an access denial from the server.

=head2 Useful Rewrite Ideas

You can use Apache's C<mod_rewrite> module to make Mig URLs more simplified
and easier to remember.  Here's what I do on my own site:

First, define simple shortcut names using the jumpMap (see the
E<quot>jumpE<quot> document).

Then, add a rule or two like this to F<httpd.conf>:

  RewriteRule ^/go/([^/]+)        /gallery/index.php?jump=$1    [R]
  RewriteRule ^/photo/([^/]+)     /gallery/index.php?jump=$1    [R]

That way you can use URLs like this:

  http://tangledhelix.com/photo/kate
  http://tangledhelix.com/go/kate

And it will automatically go to the right place.  You can also do your own
custom shortcuts of course, like these:

  RewriteRule ^/kate           /gallery/index.php?jump=kate     [R]
  RewriteRule ^/house          /gallery/index.php?jump=house    [R]
  RewriteRule ^/europe         /gallery/index.php?jump=europe   [R]

So you can have even simpler URLs if you want for certain galleries, like
http://tangledhelix.com/kate/

Naturally you will need to put C<RewriteEngine on> in the config prior to
these rules, and have C<mod_rewrite> built into your installation of
Apache, for this to work.
