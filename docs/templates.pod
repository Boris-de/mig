=head2 Templates

Template files give you control of the layout of output pages.
Colors are also handled by the template files (see later in this document).

Note that if you like the page layout already, you do not
need to touch the template files at all.  You should only modify a template
file if you have something in the page layout you wish to change or if you
have a need to change the colorization of different elements in Mig.

=head2 About Tags

Template files are simply HTML files with special tags embedded in
them.  Mig expands these tags at runtime.

Tags are surrounded by C<%%> marks, such as this example:

    <br>
    Contact <a href="mailto:%%maintAddr%%">%%maintAddr%%</a> with any
        comments or problems.
    <br>

In this case, C<%%maintAddr%%> is the relevant tag name.

You can control the page layout by modifying and/or moving HTML
elements and/or Mig tag elements in the template file.  It is assumed you
have an understanding of HTML - modify the templates at your own risk, and
always make a backup copy beforehand in case your changes don't work out
the way you wanted them to.

There is a glossary of tags later in this document.

If you don't know anything about HTML you can try checking out
http://www.htmlhelp.com/ or looking for some other online help sites by
using a search engine such as Google [ http://www.google.com ].

=head2 Including Files

An E<quot>includeE<quot> function is also provided.  To include a file,
place a directive like this one, on a line by itself:

    #include "filename";

Such as:

    #include "custom.html";

The contents of the file you specify will be inserted in place of the
C<#include> placeholder.

If the file mentioned by C<#include> is a CGI file then it will be
executed, and its output will be placed there instead.  NOTE: CGI can only
be used if you are using an Apache server (and not even every installation
of Apache will do this correctly).  Sorry, it's a limitation in PHP
that I can't work around.

If you are including a CGI make sure it prints appropriate HTTP headers
before anything else (just like any other situation where you use CGI).

Please note some things about C<#include>:

=over 4

=item 1.

All files you wish to include must live in the F<templates> subdirectory
of your Mig installation.

=item 2.

However, if you really don't want to do that (because it means you
have to maintain two copies of the same file in different locations,
etc), a symbolic link will also work.  For example:

    ln -s /www/htdocs/includes/custom.html /www/htdocs/mig/templates

In this case you would have F</www/htdocs/includes/custom.html> which
is the real file, and a symbolic link called F<custom.html> in
F</www/htdocs/mig/templates> which would point to the real file,
leaving you with only one copy to maintain.

=item 3.

The C<#include> directive must be on a line by itself.  It will not
function if anything else is on that line.  Also, the filename
must be in quotation marks, and the command must be terminated with
a semicolon.  Here are some examples:

    #include "custom.html";           # RIGHT
    #include "custom.html"            # WRONG - no semicolon
    #include custom.html;             # WRONG - no quotes
    <p>#include "custom.html";</p>    # WRONG - not alone on line

=item 4.

As of version 1.2.5 you can include PHP files as well as other types of
files.  The one difference is that for PHP files you have to make sure the
filename has an extension of either E<quot>.phpE<quot> or
E<quot>.php3E<quot>.

Look at either F<image.html> or F<folder.html> for an example (C<#include>
is used to embed the CSS style sheet file C<style.css>).

=head2 Special Files

There are three special files that Mig uses for its own purposes.

=over 4

=item *

F<templates/folder.html> - used for any view where folders and/or
thumbnail images are shown.

=item *

F<templates/image.html> - used for any view where an image is shown
by itself.

=item *

F<templates/style.css> - Contains C<text/css> (Cascading Style Sheet)
markup.

=back

If you are running Mig in PHP-Nuke Compatible mode (see
the E<quot>phpnukeE<quot> document) then these three files are not used.
In their place you will instead find:

=over 4

=item *

F<templates/mig_folder.php> - Used for folder/thumbnail views

=item *

F<templates/mig_image.php> - Used for E<quot>single imageE<quot> views

=back

(The CSS style sheet is not used in PHP-Nuke mode because PHP-Nuke uses its
own CSS style system and Mig aims not to interfere with that.)

=head2 Defined Tags

The following is a glossary of recognized Mig template tags, and what they
are expanded to.

=item 1.

Tags for use in any template

=over 4

=item %%baseURL%%

This can be customized per-folder as well.

=head2 Custom Per-folder Templates

If desired, one can define a per-folder template file.  This can be done
with the C<FolderTemplate> entity, as discussed in the E<quot>mig_cfE<quot>
document.

=head2 Managing Colors

Mig uses a Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) file to manage all of its element
colorization.  Things like the page background, background colors for table
cells, all are managed by the CSS file F<templates/style.css>.

(Note that if you are using E<quot>PHP-Nuke compatibleE<quot> mode, CSS is
ignored because PHP-Nuke uses its own CSS styles.  See the
E<quot>phpnukeE<quot> document).

I don't have the inclination or time to give a tutorial on how CSS works,
so please see http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/css/ or whatever else you
come across to figure out how CSS works.  There are some books on this
topic available as well (try searching for E<quot>CSSE<quot> at Amazon.com).

A basic example or two follow, though.

To change color of HREF links from C<#0000FF> (blue) to C<#00FF00> (green):

    Before:      A:link    { color: #0000FF }
    After:       A:link    { color: #00FF00 }

To change background color of description tables from C<#CCCCFF> (grey)
to C<#FF0000> (red):

    Before:
        TD.desc {
            color: #000000;
            background: #CCCCFF;
            text-align: justify;
        }

    After:
        TD.desc {
            color: #000000;
            background: #FF0000;
            text-align: justify;
        }

The E<quot>BODYE<quot> element controls the main background / text color
for the pages overall.  However, Netscape seems to have forgotten the BODY
element when implementing their CSS engine, so Netscape doesn't handle this
correctly.  For that reason, a default coloration of white background /
black text is hard-coded into the HTML templates in the BODY element.  If
you want to use another colorization for BODY, feel free to do so, but be
aware you'll need to update both F<templates/style.css> and
F<templates/*.html> to do it correctly.
