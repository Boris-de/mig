=head2 Templates

Page layout is handled using template files wherever possible.

=head2 About Tags

Template files are simply HTML files with special tags embedded in
them.  Mig expands these tags at runtime.

Tags are surrounded by C<%%> marks, such as this example:

    <title>%%pageTitle%%</title>

In this case, E<quot>pageTitleE<quot> is the relevant tag name.

There is a glossary of tags later in this document.

If you don't know anything about HTML you can try checking out
http://www.htmlhelp.com/ or looking for some other online help sites by
using a search engine such as Google [ http://www.google.com ].

Make backups of template files before modifying them in case things don't
work out as expected.

=head2 Including Files

An E<quot>includeE<quot> function is provided.  To include a file,
place a directive like this one on a line by itself:

    #include "filename";

Such as:

    #include "custom.html";

The contents of the specified file will be inserted in place of the
C<#include> placeholder.

If the file mentioned by C<#include> is a CGI file then it will be
executed, and its output will be placed there instead.  NOTE: CGI can only
be used with Apache servers (and not even every installation
of Apache will do this correctly).  Sorry, it's a limitation in PHP
that I can't work around.

If including a CGI make sure it prints appropriate HTTP headers
before anything else (just like any other situation where CGI is used).

Please note some things about C<#include>:

=over 4

=item 1.

Included files must be located in the F<templates> directory.

=item 2.

If that's undesirable, a symbolic link will also work.  For example:

    ln -s /www/htdocs/includes/custom.html /www/htdocs/mig/templates

This would create a symbolic link F</www/htdocs/mig/templates/custom.html>
which would point to the real file F</www/htdocs/includes/custom.html>.
Thus, there's only one copy to maintain.

=item 3.

The C<#include> directive must be on a line by itself.  It will not
function if anything else is on that line.  Also, the filename
must be in quotation marks, and the command must be terminated with
a semicolon.  Here are some examples:

    #include "custom.html";           # RIGHT
    #include "custom.html"            # WRONG - no semicolon
    #include custom.html;             # WRONG - no quotes
    <p>#include "custom.html";</p>    # WRONG - not alone on line

=item 4.

As of version 1.2.5 it is possible to include PHP files as well as other
types of files.  The one difference is that for PHP files the filename must
have an extension of either E<quot>.phpE<quot> or E<quot>.php3E<quot>.

Look at either F<image.html> or F<folder.html> for an example (C<#include>
is used to embed the CSS style sheet file C<style.css>).

=head2 Special Files

There are three special files that Mig uses for its own purposes.

=over 4

=item *

F<templates/folder.html> - used for any view where folders and/or
thumbnail images are shown.

=item *

F<templates/image.html> - used for any view where an image is shown
by itself.

=item *

F<templates/style.css> - Contains C<text/css> (Cascading Style Sheet)
markup.

=back

If you are using PHP-Nuke or PostNuke mode, these three will not exist.
In their place you'll find F<mig_folder.php> and F<mig_image.php> which
are the same basically as F<folder.html> and F<image.html> respectively.
In Nuke mode the CSS file is not used (Nuke systems have their own CSS
already).

=head2 Defined Tags

The following is a glossary of recognized Mig template tags, and what they
are expanded to.

=head2 Custom Per-folder Templates

If desired, one can define a per-folder template file.  This can be done
with the C<FolderTemplate> entity, as discussed in the E<quot>mig_cfE<quot>
document.

=head2 Managing Colors

Mig uses a Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) file to manage all of its element
colorization.  Things like the page background, background colors for table
cells, all are managed by the CSS file F<templates/style.css>.

I don't have the inclination or time to write a tutorial on how CSS works,
so please see http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/css/ or whatever else you
come across to figure out how CSS works.  There are some books on this
topic available as well (try searching for E<quot>CSSE<quot> at Amazon.com).

A basic example or two follow, though.

To change color of HREF links from C<#0000FF> (blue) to C<#00FF00> (green):

    Before:      A:link    { color: #0000FF }
    After:       A:link    { color: #00FF00 }

To change background color of description tables from C<#CCCCFF> (grey)
to C<#FF0000> (red):

    Before:
        TD.desc {
            color: #000000;
            background: #CCCCFF;
            text-align: justify;
        }

    After:
        TD.desc {
            color: #000000;
            background: #FF0000;
            text-align: justify;
        }

The E<quot>BODYE<quot> element controls the main background / text color
for the pages overall.  However, Netscape seems to have forgotten the BODY
element when implementing their CSS engine, so Netscape doesn't handle this
correctly.  For that reason, a default coloration of white background /
black text is hard-coded into the HTML templates in the BODY element.  If
you want to use another colorization for BODY, feel free to do so, but be
aware you'll need to update both F<templates/style.css> and
F<templates/*.html> to do it correctly.
