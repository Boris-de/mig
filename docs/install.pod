=head2 Requirements

Mig requires a web server which supports PHP [ http://www.php.net/ ].
The development platform is Apple OSX, so the code tends to assume
a Unix-like environment.  As such it may or may not work (and has not
been tested by the author) on non-unix-like platforms.

Windows users, please see the section labeled
E<quot>Running Mig Under WindowsE<quot> below.

The F<mkGallery> utility (used to generate thumbnail images) requires Perl
[ http://www.perl.com ].  If you want to generate thumbnail images, it also
requires ImageMagick [ http://www.imagemagick.org/ ].  Neither are required
to use Mig itself.

The F<jhead> utility which is called by F<mkGallery> for EXIF header
parsing is a C source code file - you will need to compile it before using
it.  On most systems you can just type E<quot>makeE<quot> in the F<jhead>
directory to build it and you will end up with an executable named
F<jhead>.

Since most Windows systems do not come with a C compiler, and my
understanding is that you have to buy one if you want one, I'd advise
Windows users to get the pre-built F<jhead> program from Mathias Wandel's
jhead home page: http://www.sentex.net/~mwandel/jhead/

See the E<quot>utilitiesE<quot> document for more information about
F<mkGallery> and F<jhead>.

=head2 New Installation

Read this section if you are installing Mig for the first time.  If you
are upgrading, skip to the next section which deals with upgrading.

=over 4

=item 1.

Create a directory to install Mig into, somewhere your web server can read
the files and serve them as web pages.

=item 2.

Copy the file F<index.php> to your Mig directory.

=item 3.

Copy the file F<config.php.default> to your Mig directory and call it
F<config.php>.  This is where you can change settings to customize Mig.

=item 4.

Create three subdirectories called F<images>, F<templates> and F<albums>
under your Mig directory.

=item 5.

Copy the files F<image.gif> and F<no_thumb.gif> from the F<images>
subdirectory to the F<images> subdirectory you just made.

=item 6.

Copy the files F<image.html>, F<folder.html> and F<style.css> from the
F<templates> subdirectory to the F<templates> subdirectory you just made.

=item 7.

Put image files (your photos, etc) into the F<albums> subdirectory.
You can make subdirectories to contain different categories of images,
and those subdirectories can contain subdirectories, and so on.  Mig
doesn't place any restriction on how many levels deep your subdirectories
go.  Arrange the album any way you want.  The name of each album is the
name of the directory, so keep that in mind as you create subdirectories.
For example:

    People
        Family
        Friends
    The_Zoo
        Dolphins
        Bears
        Lions
    Cars

Notice that I used an underline character in B<The_Zoo>.  Mig will display
that as a space, so the album will be called B<The Zoo> as far as visitors
will know.  This makes things simpler since some systems make using
underlines in directory names unfriendly.

The above example ends up being these eight gallery folders:

    People
    People : Family
    People : Friends
    The Zoo
    The Zoo : Dolphins
    The Zoo : Bears
    The Zoo : Lions
    Cars

Mig supports JPEG, GIF and PNG files.  So files with any of these
extensions will be recognized:

    .gif .png .jpg .jpe .jpeg

=item 8.

You're all set - point your browser wherever you installed Mig and you
should be ready to go!

=item 9.

If you wish to create thumbnails, use the included F<mkGallery> script if
you have shell access to your server, and you have Perl and ImageMagick
available.  Otherwise you'll need to make your own thumbnails some other
way, or just not use thumbnails.

To install your own thumbnails, create a F<thumbs> subdirectory in each of
your album directories.  Put the thumbnail images into the F<thumbs>
subdirectory.  The filename of each thumbnail should be identical to the
filename of the full-size picture it represents.

You can change the name of the thumbnail directory - see the
C<$thumbSubdir> option in F<config.php>.

=head2 Upgrading

If you are upgrading from a previous version of Mig, follow these steps:

=over 4

=item 1.

Copy the F<index.php> file to your Mig directory.  This should replace the
F<index.php> you already had there.

=item 2.

Starting with version 1.3.1, F<mig.cfg> is now called F<config.php>.
If you have a F<mig.cfg>, rename it to F<config.php>.  The distribution
comes with F<config.php.default>, which is the new default config file
(mostly used as an example - you don't need config.php.default in your
actual Mig directory).

If you don't copy over F<config.php> and use Mig without it, Mig will use
the default value for each setting.

=item 3.

Starting with version 1.3.2, the F<funcs.php> and F<lang.php> files are no
longer used.  If you have them, delete them.  All code is now contained in
F<index.php>.  Mig will not fail if F<funcs.php> or F<lang.php> are
present, but it's sloppy to leave them laying around.

=item 4.

If you use F<mkGallery>, copy mkGallery from the F<utilities> directory
to someplace on your system that makes sense to you.

=item 5.

If you use F<jhead> (note that using the EXIF functions of F<mkGallery>
implies using F<jhead>), you may wish to compile a new copy of F<jhead>
if it's a newer version than you're using now (to find out when F<jhead>
was last updated, check the E<quot>changelogE<quot> document).

If you want F<mkGallery> to be able to use F<jhead>, put F<jhead> in the
same directory as F<mkGallery>.

=back

=head2 Running Mig Under Windows

Mig can run fine under Windows (so I'm told) as long as you have a web
server that supports PHP.  You can find the Windows version of PHP at
http://www.php.net/

Mig is reported to work with IIS, Personal Web Server, and the Windows port
of Apache.  One user noted that you needed a fairly recent version of PHP
for it to work, so if you're having trouble, make sure you're using the
most recent release of PHP.

Another user reported that having a comma in the directory name of any
album would cause problems, so you should avoid doing that.

=head2 The Example Gallery

If you want to see an example gallery (that is, install one on your system
and examine the files that it contains), you can download one from the Mig
project page at http://sf.net/projects/mig/ (look in the 'mig-extras'
section in the project files listing).  After you download the file, unpack
it in your albums directory and you should be able to view it in your web
browser.

=head2 Optional Customization

=over 4

=item 1. HTML templates (and colors)

You can edit the HTML templates found in the F<templates> subdirectory.
See the E<quot>templatesE<quot> document for more information.  You can
also use a custom per-folder template file in each folder if desired - see
the E<quot>mig_cfE<quot> document for more information.

=item 2. Comments

You can add a comment for any image you wish.  Comments are stored in a
file called F<mig.cf> in the same directory as the image.  See the
E<quot>mig_cfE<quot> document for information about the format of
F<mig.cf>.

Comments are shown in a box below the image in image views.  In
thumbnail views, they are shown as the ALT tag text.  (You can suppress
ALT tags by setting C<$suppressAltTags> to C<TRUE> in F<config.php>).

As an example, let's say you had files F<house.jpg>, F<car.gif> and
F<dog.jpg>.  Let's say you wanted a comment on the house and the dog,
but nothing in particular to say about the car.  You would add
this to F<mig.cf>:

    <Comment "house.jpg">
    This is my house, which I bought in the fall of 1998.
    </Comment>

    <Comment "dog.jpg">
    This is the dog we had when I was growing up.  She was a lot of
    fun!  Sadly, she died when I was 12 years old (she had cancer).
    We had other dogs afterward, but none of them were as much fun.
    </Comment>

(If you are using F<mkGallery>, you should look at the C<-c> option
which handles comments.)

You can have as many lines as you want for the description.  The key is
that the description must be enclosed inside the
E<lt>CommentE<gt>...E<lt>/CommentE<gt> structure.  The tags such as
E<lt>CommentE<gt> and E<lt>/CommentE<gt> MUST be at the start of a new
line.

=item 3. EXIF data

You can build EXIF data files (F<exif.inf>) using F<mkGallery> and the
C<-e> option.  See the E<quot>utilitiesE<quot> document.  Note that you
must have the F<jhead> utility in place before the C<-e> option will
function.  (See above during the install procedure.) Since only JPEG files
support EXIF headers, F<mkGallery> will only look at JPEG files when
building the EXIF files.

EXIF data generally contains information such as shutter speed, aperture,
ISO rating, the original shooting date and time, and sometimes comments.
Mig can read some, but not all, of this data.  Future versions of Mig may
understand more of the data than it currently does.

NOTE that most graphic editors destroy EXIF blocks!  They don't know how to
write them so when they save images, they are simply not written back into
the file.  You can get around this by building the EXIF data using your raw
images, and then editing them afterward.  This may not be an option for
everybody, but there's nothing I can do about it.

=item 4. Item sorting

You can define your own sort order (rather than relying on alphabetical
sorting).  Just define a E<lt>sortE<gt> block in the folder's F<mig.cf>
file and put items in the order you want them to be in.  For example:

    <sort>
    img_0436.jpg
    img_4938.jpg
    img_4812.jpg
    </sort>

What happens if there are files present other than the ones you listed?
They'll appear after those first three, sorted alphabetically.

You can sort folders, too, if your folder has subfolders.  Just define
another sort block with folders instead of images.  Mig will figure out
which is which automatically.

=item 5. Languages other than English

Mig has support for other languages - however, it only supports those
languages someone has supplied translations for.  As I write this,
that means English and French.  If you want to translate it to another
language, please get in touch with me and I'll be glad to add your
translations to the available list of languages.

(see F<config.php.default> for more information - Mig now supports English,
French, German, Norwegian, Portugese, Finnish, Romanian, Russian
Windows-1251, Russian KOI8-R, Turkish, Swedish, Danish, Italian, Spanish,
Slovak, Dutch and Polish).

If you are interested in translating Mig to another language, please
contact me by email at I<dan at tangledhelix.com>.

=item 6. Pop-up windows

If you want to use Pop-up windows for your images, see the C<$imagePopup>
and C<$imagePopType> variables in F<config.php>.

=head2 Email Lists

There are three mailing lists related to Mig.  Visit the URLs below if
you wish to subscribe.  All lists are currently fairly low-traffic.

mig-announce is an announcements-only list.  Generally speaking that
means the only traffic it gets are announcements of new versions posted
by the author.

    http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/mig-announce

mig-users is a general discussion list.  Any Mig-related topic can be
discussed on this list.  Note also that I typically send announcements
here, so if you subscribe to mig-users you don't necessarily have to
subscribe to mig-announce as well (but you can if you want to).

    http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/mig-users

mig-devel is for people interested in development work related to Mig.
