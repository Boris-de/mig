## Credits

This is where I thank people who have contributed things to Mig.  I hope I
haven't left anyone out, but if I have, please let me know.  This list
is in reverse chronological order - newer entries are nearer the top
(except the first two which are always at the top).

A huge thanks to Rasmus Lerdorf and all the other fine folks who have
worked so hard to make PHP available in the first place.  PHP programmers
truly stand on the shoulders of giants.

A special note to recognize Matthias Wendel, author of the `jhead`
utility, which is bundled with Mig.

translation.
