This is where I thank people who have contributed things to Mig.  I hope I
haven't left anyone out, but if I have, please let me know.

Fadel (fadel at fee.unicamp.br), for contributing code which was the
basis for the C<-c> option of F<mkGallery.pl>, and for the Portugese
translation.

Jeff Lambert (jeffx at ican.net), for contributing code to make a
PHP-Nuke compatibility mode for people wanting to merge Mig into
a PHP-Nuke site [ http://www.phpnuke.org/ ].  Jeff also found a number of
nagging little bugs in Mig which have been fixed.

Russ McClay (mcclay at taolodge.com.tw), for finding a strange table format
problem where a horizontal line above and to the left side of the table would
appear.  Fixing this fixed another strange bug where sometimes things
weren't centered.

Adam Monsen (meonkeys at hotmail.com), for reporting the E<quot>..E<quot>
security hole.

BUL (burckhard at loeh.cx), for working out the kinks for Mig users who are
on a Windows platform, and for the German translation.

truly stand on the shoulders of giants.
