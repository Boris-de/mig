This is where I thank people who have contributed things to Mig.  I hope I
haven't left anyone out, but if I have, please let me know.

Fadel (fadel at fee.unicamp.br), for contributing code which eventually
turned into the C<-c> option of the F<mkGallery> script, and for the
Portugese translation.

Jeff Lambert (jeffx at ican.net), for contributing code to make a
E<quot>phpNuke CompatibleE<quot> mode for folks wanting to merge Mig into a
phpNuke site [ http://www.phpnuke.org/ ].  Jeff also found a number of
nagging little bugs in Mig which have been fixed.

Russ McClay (mcclay at taolodge.com.tw), for finding the strange table
format problem where you would see a horizontal line above and to the left
side of the screen.  Fixing this fixed another strange bug where sometimes
things weren't centered.

Adam Monsen (meonkeys at hotmail.com), for noticing and reporting the
E<quot>..E<quot> security hole.

BUL (burckhard at loeh.cx), for going through lots of headache working
out the kinks for Mig users who are running on a Windows platform, and for
the German translation.

Jevin Maltais (jevin at techie.com) and Brian Palik (bpalik at elitepub.com),
for inspiring the eminently useful C<#include> feature of templates.

Artem G. Abanov (aga at andrey.physics.wisc.edu), for writing the
contrib script F<migPutCommentInFile>.

Jaap Geurts (j.geurts at tech.nhl.nl), for contributing a change to make
F<mkGallery> do things in sorted order.

Jon Anhold (jon at snoopy.net), for contributing code which turned into
the C<$suppressImageInfo> option.

jE<eacute>rE<ocirc>me ROUER (CCFRANCE.bibli at bigpond.com.kh), for the
French translation.

Joffer aka Christopher Thorjussen (joffer at online.no), for the
Norwegian translation.

Jani Mikkonen (jani at mikkonen.org), for the Finnish translation.

Eugen Dedu (dedu at ese-metz.fr) for the Romanian translation.

Anatoly Ropotov (lynx at rulez.lv) for the Russian translations.

Dogan Sariguzel (dogan at procam.com.tr) for the Turkish translation.

Sebastian DjupsjE<ouml>backa (basse at iki.fi) for the Swedish translation.

Mikkel Mondrup Kristensen (hh00d-mmk at uv.horshs.dk) for the Danish
translation.

Alessandro Poletto (pollok at toth.it) and Marco Ermini
(markoer at firenze.linux.it) for their Italian translations.

Juro Polak (polak at axon.sk) for the Slovak translation.

Erik at Braindisorder.org for the Dutch translation.

JMN (umjumasa at terra.es) for an update to the Spanish translation.

GE<ouml>ran FrE<ouml>jdh (goran at frojdh.com) for the code on which the
pop-up window feature is based.

Martin (martvin at box43.pl) for the Polish translation.

Simon Wood (simon at mungewell.org) for contributing the patch to create the
C<MaintAddr> keyword in F<mig.cf> files.

A special note to recognize Matthias Wendel, author of the F<jhead>
utility, which is bundled with Mig.

And of course, to Rasmus Lerdorf and all of the other fine folks who have
worked so hard to make PHP available in the first place.  PHP programmers
truly stand on the shoulders of giants.
