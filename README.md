## Git tags

Most of the tags are converted from the original CVS, but some where missing
and added later (v1.2.7, v1.2.7p1, v1.2.8, v1.2.9r, v1.3.0) based the commit
mesages and a comparison of the content of the release tarballs. For 1.2.9 a
slight difference between the commit and the tar exists, hence the "r"-suffix
