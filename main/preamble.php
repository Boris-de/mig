// Please see the files in the docs subdirectory.
//
// Do not modify this file directly.  Please see docs/text/install.txt
// or docs/html/install.html for installation directions.  Most things
// you'd want to customize can be customized outside of this file.
// (Exception: if you need to use the $pathConvert* features those should
// be modified here).
//
// If you find that is not the case, and you hack in support for some
// feature you want to see in Mig, please contact me with a code diff and
// if I agree that it is useful to the general public, I will incorporate
// your code into the main code base for distribution.  If you have GNU
// diff, a unified diff is best (diff -u), if you don't, then contextual
// diff works too (diff -c).
//
// If I don't incorporate it I may very well offer it as "contributed"
// code that others can download if they wish to do so.
