
Change notes:

* Now recognizes more Exif tags (Contributions by Volker C Schoen)

Bugfixes:
* Follow the TIFF directory links in the Exif correctly, not just the Exif link.
  This necessary for extracting the thumbnail from the exif header.  Thansk to
  Michael D Hughes (mdh@logcabin.woods.bridge.com) for explaining his subtle 
  nuance of Exif file headers.
* No longer crop comments at 200 characters.

1.3 --> 1.4  (Oct 9 2001)
* Fixed saving of thumbnails for big-endian format cameras
* Wen renaming files to date based scheme, avoid changing names of files with 
  correct name already.
* Added '-de' option to remove exif header
* Added '-ts' option to set exif timestamp absolutely

1.4 --> 1.5  (Oct 25 2001)
* Minor typos fixed
